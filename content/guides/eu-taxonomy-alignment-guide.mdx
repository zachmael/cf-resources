## Overview

The EU Taxonomy Regulation (Regulation 2020/852) establishes a classification system that defines which economic activities qualify as environmentally sustainable. It is the EU's foundational tool for directing capital toward activities that contribute to its environmental objectives, and it plays a central role in the broader sustainable finance regulatory architecture alongside the CSRD and the Sustainable Finance Disclosure Regulation (SFDR).

The Taxonomy is organized around six environmental objectives: climate change mitigation, climate change adaptation, sustainable use and protection of water and marine resources, transition to a circular economy, pollution prevention and control, and protection and restoration of biodiversity and ecosystems. For an activity to qualify as Taxonomy-aligned, it must make a substantial contribution to at least one objective, do no significant harm (DNSH) to the remaining five, and comply with minimum social safeguards.

The Taxonomy is not aspirational guidance—it is a regulatory framework with specific quantitative thresholds. A power generation facility either meets the emissions intensity threshold of 100g CO₂e/kWh or it does not. A building either qualifies as a nearly zero-energy building under local regulation or it does not. This precision makes the Taxonomy both powerful and demanding.

## Who Does It Apply To?

**Non-financial undertakings** subject to the CSRD must disclose the proportion of their turnover, capital expenditure (CapEx), and operating expenditure (OpEx) associated with Taxonomy-eligible and Taxonomy-aligned economic activities.

**Financial market participants** offering financial products in the EU must disclose the degree of Taxonomy alignment of their products under the SFDR.

**Financial undertakings** including credit institutions, investment firms, insurance and reinsurance undertakings, and asset managers must disclose Taxonomy KPIs specific to their sector (e.g., the Green Asset Ratio for banks).

**EU Member States** must reference the Taxonomy when setting standards for green financial products, green bonds (under the EU Green Bond Standard), and environmental labels.

In practice, the Taxonomy's influence extends far beyond directly regulated entities. Companies seeking green financing, participating in sustainable supply chains, or responding to investor ESG questionnaires increasingly need to demonstrate Taxonomy alignment.

## Key Requirements

**1. Eligibility Assessment**
Determine which of your economic activities are covered by the Taxonomy's technical screening criteria. Eligibility means the activity is described in the delegated acts—it does not mean the activity is environmentally sustainable. Eligibility is the first filter; alignment is the second.

**2. Substantial Contribution Criteria**
For each eligible activity, assess whether it meets the specific technical screening criteria for making a substantial contribution to one or more environmental objectives. These criteria are quantitative and activity-specific. For example, electricity generation from wind power substantially contributes to climate mitigation by definition, while cement manufacturing must demonstrate lifecycle emissions below 0.469 tCO₂e per tonne of product.

**3. Do No Significant Harm (DNSH) Assessment**
An activity that substantially contributes to one objective must not significantly harm any of the other five. The delegated acts specify DNSH criteria for each activity-objective combination. This assessment requires reviewing compliance with EU environmental legislation including the Water Framework Directive, Waste Framework Directive, Industrial Emissions Directive, and others.

**4. Minimum Social Safeguards**
The activity must be carried out in compliance with minimum social safeguards, defined by reference to the OECD Guidelines for Multinational Enterprises, the UN Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights, the ILO Core Conventions, and the International Bill of Human Rights. Companies must demonstrate due diligence processes to identify and address adverse human rights impacts.

**5. KPI Calculation and Reporting**
Non-financial companies must calculate and disclose three KPIs: Taxonomy-aligned turnover as a percentage of total turnover, Taxonomy-aligned CapEx as a percentage of total CapEx, and Taxonomy-aligned OpEx as a percentage of total OpEx. These calculations require mapping financial data to individual economic activities—a nontrivial exercise for diversified companies.

**6. Reporting Templates**
The Commission has prescribed detailed reporting templates that require activity-by-activity disclosure across all six environmental objectives. These templates are complex and require granular data on each economic activity's contribution, DNSH compliance, and financial metrics.

## Timeline & Milestones

| Milestone | Date |
|-----------|------|
| Taxonomy Regulation enters into force | July 2020 |
| Climate Delegated Act (objectives 1 & 2) adopted | June 2021 |
| First Taxonomy eligibility reporting (large PIEs) | FY 2021 |
| First Taxonomy alignment reporting (large PIEs) | FY 2022 |
| Environmental Delegated Act (objectives 3–6) adopted | June 2023 |
| Reporting on all six objectives begins | FY 2023 |
| CSRD Phase 2 companies begin Taxonomy reporting | FY 2025 |
| CSRD Phase 3 companies (listed SMEs) begin | FY 2026 |
| EU Green Bond Standard requires Taxonomy alignment | 2025 |

The delegated acts continue to evolve. The Platform on Sustainable Finance regularly recommends updates and extensions to the technical screening criteria. Companies should monitor these developments as new activities are added and existing criteria are refined.

## Step-by-Step Compliance Roadmap

### Step 1: Activity Mapping

Create a comprehensive inventory of your economic activities, mapped against the NACE codes referenced in the Taxonomy delegated acts. This requires collaboration between sustainability, finance, and business unit teams. For each activity, determine Taxonomy eligibility across all six environmental objectives. Document activities that are not covered by the Taxonomy (non-eligible) separately.

### Step 2: Technical Screening Assessment

For each eligible activity, evaluate compliance with the substantial contribution criteria. This is where the real analytical work begins. Gather the operational and performance data needed to assess against quantitative thresholds. For activities with multiple potential substantial contribution objectives, assess each and select the primary contribution. Engage technical experts where criteria require engineering, environmental, or scientific assessment.

### Step 3: DNSH and Safeguards Evaluation

Systematically assess each substantially contributing activity against the DNSH criteria for the remaining five objectives. This typically involves reviewing environmental compliance records, environmental impact assessments, and management systems. Concurrently, evaluate compliance with minimum social safeguards by reviewing human rights due diligence processes, labor practices, and anti-corruption measures across operations and key supply chains.

### Step 4: Financial KPI Calculation

Work with finance teams to allocate turnover, CapEx, and OpEx to individual economic activities. Establish clear allocation methodologies for shared costs and multi-activity revenue streams. Calculate Taxonomy-aligned percentages using the denominators specified in the delegated acts. Ensure consistency between Taxonomy KPIs and financial statement data.

### Step 5: Disclosure and Verification

Populate the prescribed reporting templates with activity-level data. Include qualitative context explaining your Taxonomy assessment methodology, key judgments, and data limitations. Integrate Taxonomy disclosures into your CSRD management report. Engage assurance providers to verify Taxonomy disclosures as part of the broader CSRD assurance engagement.

## Common Pitfalls

**Confusing eligibility with alignment.** A common error is reporting a high eligibility percentage as though it indicates strong environmental performance. Eligibility simply means the Taxonomy has criteria for your activity. Alignment means you meet those criteria. Investors understand the difference—misrepresenting eligibility as alignment damages credibility.

**Underestimating the DNSH assessment.** Many companies focus on substantial contribution criteria and treat DNSH as a formality. In practice, DNSH assessment can be the most demanding element, requiring detailed compliance evidence across multiple EU environmental directives. Companies with operations outside the EU may face particular challenges demonstrating equivalent compliance.

**Inadequate financial data granularity.** The Taxonomy requires allocation of turnover, CapEx, and OpEx to specific economic activities. Companies whose financial systems are not structured at this level of granularity will struggle. Early investment in financial data mapping pays significant dividends.

**Overlooking the social safeguards.** Minimum social safeguards are a pass/fail criterion. Companies without established human rights due diligence processes will find that no activity can be reported as Taxonomy-aligned, regardless of its environmental credentials.

## Frequently Asked Questions

### What if our main economic activities are not covered by the Taxonomy?

Many sectors and activities are not yet included in the Taxonomy delegated acts. In that case, your Taxonomy-eligible percentage will be low or zero, and you should report this transparently. A low eligibility figure does not indicate poor environmental performance—it means the Taxonomy has not yet defined criteria for your activities. You can still report CapEx plans related to Taxonomy-eligible activities and explain your broader sustainability strategy in the management report.

### How do we handle activities that operate across multiple environmental objectives?

An activity can be assessed for substantial contribution to multiple objectives, but you must avoid double-counting in your KPIs. If an activity substantially contributes to climate mitigation and biodiversity, report it under the primary objective and note the additional contribution. The reporting templates provide columns for each objective, allowing transparent disclosure of multi-objective activities.

### Does the Taxonomy apply to non-EU companies?

Directly, the Taxonomy reporting obligation applies to companies within CSRD scope, including non-EU companies meeting the Phase 4 thresholds. Indirectly, non-EU companies face Taxonomy requirements through their EU subsidiaries' reporting obligations, through SFDR requirements on financial products containing their securities, and through EU customers and partners that need Taxonomy data for their own reporting. The Taxonomy's influence on global capital flows means that non-EU companies increasingly benefit from demonstrating alignment.
