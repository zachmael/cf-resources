## Overview

Climate risk assessment has evolved from a voluntary disclosure exercise into a strategic imperative underpinned by regulation. The Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures (TCFD) established the foundational framework, and its recommendations are now embedded in mandatory requirements across jurisdictions: CSRD (via ESRS E1), ISSB standards (IFRS S2), the UK's Climate-related Financial Disclosure regulations, and climate disclosure rules in Australia, Japan, Singapore, and New Zealand.

The core premise is straightforward: climate change creates material financial risks and opportunities that companies must identify, assess, and manage. These fall into two categories. Physical risks — both acute (extreme weather events) and chronic (sea-level rise, temperature shifts, water stress) — threaten assets, supply chains, and operations. Transition risks — policy changes, technology disruption, market shifts, and reputational impacts — arise from the global shift toward a lower-carbon economy.

Organizations that conduct rigorous climate risk assessments gain more than regulatory compliance. They identify vulnerabilities before they become crises, surface strategic opportunities in the transition, and build the resilience that investors increasingly demand. Climate risk assessment is not an environmental exercise — it is an enterprise risk management exercise with financial consequences.

## Who Does It Apply To?

- **CSRD-reporting entities** — ESRS E1 requires climate risk and opportunity identification, scenario analysis, and financial impact quantification
- **ISSB reporters** — IFRS S2 mandates climate-related risk disclosure including scenario analysis
- **UK premium-listed companies, large private companies, and financial institutions** subject to mandatory TCFD-aligned disclosure
- **Companies in Australia, New Zealand, Japan, and Singapore** under emerging mandatory climate disclosure regimes
- **Financial institutions** managing climate risk in lending, investment, and insurance portfolios (ECB, PRA, APRA expectations)
- **Companies with significant physical asset bases** — real estate, infrastructure, utilities, agriculture, transportation
- **Organizations seeking to strengthen enterprise risk management** by integrating climate scenarios into strategic planning

## Key Requirements

1. **Identify climate-related risks and opportunities** across short, medium, and long-term time horizons relevant to your business. Define these horizons explicitly (e.g., short: 0–3 years, medium: 3–10 years, long: 10–30+ years).

2. **Conduct scenario analysis** using at least two climate scenarios — typically a 1.5°C/2°C orderly transition scenario and a 3°C+ high-physical-risk scenario. CSRD recommends alignment with IPCC Representative Concentration Pathways (RCPs) or Shared Socioeconomic Pathways (SSPs).

3. **Assess physical risks** at the asset and location level using climate projection data, vulnerability assessments, and exposure analysis. Consider both acute events and chronic shifts.

4. **Assess transition risks** across policy and legal, technology, market, and reputation dimensions. Evaluate carbon pricing exposure, stranded asset risk, demand shifts, and regulatory compliance costs.

5. **Quantify financial impacts** where possible — impacts on revenue, costs, asset values, capital expenditure, and access to capital. ESRS E1 requires quantification of material financial effects.

6. **Integrate climate risks into enterprise risk management** frameworks, strategic planning, and capital allocation processes. Climate risk should not exist in a separate silo.

7. **Disclose governance arrangements** for climate risk oversight, including board and management roles, competencies, and decision-making processes.

## Timeline & Milestones

**Months 1–2: Scoping & Governance**
Define the scope of the assessment — geographic coverage, business units, time horizons, and scenario parameters. Establish a cross-functional working group including finance, risk, operations, strategy, and sustainability. Secure board-level sponsorship.

**Months 3–5: Risk Identification & Scenario Selection**
Conduct a comprehensive identification of physical and transition risks and opportunities. Select scenarios aligned with regulatory requirements and strategic relevance. Source climate projection data from recognized providers (IPCC, World Bank Climate Knowledge Portal, commercial providers like Jupiter Intelligence or Four Twenty Seven).

**Months 6–8: Quantitative Assessment**
Model the financial impact of identified risks under each scenario. For physical risks, use asset-level exposure analysis combined with vulnerability and hazard data. For transition risks, model carbon pricing impacts, policy compliance costs, technology substitution effects, and demand changes.

**Months 9–10: Strategy Integration**
Translate assessment findings into strategic responses: adaptation measures for physical risks, transition planning for transition risks, and investment in identified opportunities. Update risk registers, business continuity plans, and capital allocation frameworks.

**Months 11–12: Disclosure & Reporting**
Prepare climate risk disclosures aligned with ESRS E1, IFRS S2, or applicable national standards. Include governance, strategy, risk management, and metrics sections. Engage assurance providers where required.

## Step-by-Step Compliance Roadmap

### Step 1: Build Your Risk Universe

Develop a comprehensive inventory of potential climate-related risks and opportunities relevant to your sector and operating context. Use sector-specific guidance from TCFD, SASB/ISSB industry standards, and peer benchmarking. Common physical risks include flooding, wildfire, heat stress, water scarcity, and hurricane/typhoon damage. Common transition risks include carbon taxes, emissions trading costs, fossil fuel demand decline, EV mandates, and building energy performance standards.

Categorize each risk by type (physical acute, physical chronic, transition policy, transition technology, transition market, transition reputation), time horizon, and potentially affected business areas.

### Step 2: Select and Define Scenarios

Choose at least two scenarios spanning a range of outcomes:

- **Orderly transition (1.5°C or 2°C):** Aggressive climate policy, rapid technology deployment, significant transition risks but limited physical risks. Use IEA Net Zero Emissions scenario or NGFS orderly scenarios.
- **Hot house world (3°C+):** Limited climate action, high physical risks, lower transition risks in the near term. Use IPCC SSP5-8.5 or NGFS current policies scenario.
- **Optional: Disorderly transition:** Delayed then sudden policy action, combined physical and transition risks. NGFS delayed transition scenario.

For each scenario, define key assumptions: carbon price trajectory, energy mix evolution, policy timelines, temperature and precipitation projections, and sea-level rise estimates.

### Step 3: Assess Exposure and Vulnerability

**For physical risks:** Map your asset portfolio (facilities, properties, infrastructure, supply chain nodes) against climate hazard projections. Use geospatial tools and climate data platforms to assess exposure to flooding, heat stress, water scarcity, wildfire, and storms under each scenario. Evaluate asset vulnerability — construction type, elevation, flood defences, backup systems.

**For transition risks:** Assess your carbon footprint exposure to carbon pricing scenarios. Model the impact of policy changes (EV mandates, building codes, methane regulations) on your operations and products. Evaluate technology substitution risks — which of your products or services could be displaced by lower-carbon alternatives?

### Step 4: Quantify Financial Impacts

Translate risk exposures into financial terms:

- **Revenue at risk:** Products or services exposed to demand decline, market shifts, or physical disruption
- **Cost increases:** Carbon pricing, compliance costs, energy cost changes, insurance premium increases, adaptation investments
- **Asset impairment:** Stranded assets, reduced asset values due to physical risk or regulatory obsolescence
- **Capital expenditure:** Required investments in adaptation, resilience, or transition
- **Opportunity value:** New revenue streams, market positioning, efficiency gains

Use ranges rather than false precision — climate risk quantification involves genuine uncertainty. Present results under each scenario with clear assumptions.

### Step 5: Integrate and Disclose

Embed climate risk findings into your enterprise risk management framework. Assign risk owners, define risk appetites, and establish monitoring triggers. Update strategic plans, capital budgets, and business continuity procedures.

Prepare regulatory disclosures with the full TCFD/ESRS structure: governance, strategy (including scenario analysis results), risk management (how climate risks are identified, assessed, and managed), and metrics & targets (emissions, climate-related financial metrics, and targets).

## Common Pitfalls

**Conducting scenario analysis as a one-time exercise.** Climate science, policy landscapes, and your business context all evolve. Scenario analysis should be refreshed every 2–3 years at minimum, with interim updates when significant changes occur (new policy announcements, material acquisitions, extreme weather events).

**Treating climate risk as purely environmental.** Climate risk is financial risk. If the assessment sits in the sustainability department and never reaches the CFO, risk committee, or board agenda, it's not fulfilling its purpose. Integration with financial planning and enterprise risk management is essential.

**Over-relying on qualitative assessment.** Qualitative risk identification is a necessary starting point, but regulators and investors increasingly expect quantification. "Climate change poses a risk to our supply chain" is not sufficient — "Under a 3°C scenario, we estimate $50–120M in annual supply chain disruption costs by 2035" is what boards and investors need to hear.

**Ignoring opportunities.** Most climate risk assessments focus heavily on downside risks and underweight the opportunity dimension. Companies that develop climate solutions, adapt their products for a changing climate, or position for regulatory shifts can capture significant value. A balanced assessment examines both sides.

## FAQs

**What scenarios should we use?**

At minimum, use a low-warming orderly transition scenario (1.5°C or 2°C) and a high-warming scenario (3°C+). CSRD and IFRS S2 expect scenario analysis without prescribing specific scenarios. For financial institutions, NGFS scenarios are the market standard. For corporates, IEA scenarios (Net Zero Emissions, Stated Policies) are widely used for transition analysis, combined with IPCC pathways for physical risk.

**How far into the future should the analysis extend?**

Time horizons should match your strategic planning cycle and asset lifetimes. For assets with 30+ year lifespans (buildings, infrastructure, power plants), analysis should extend to 2050 or beyond. For transition risks, a 10–15 year horizon captures most material policy and market shifts. Define and disclose your time horizons explicitly.

**Do we need to quantify every risk financially?**

Not every risk can be precisely quantified, and regulators acknowledge this. Prioritize quantification for your most material risks. Use order-of-magnitude ranges where precise modelling isn't feasible. Qualitative assessment remains appropriate for lower-materiality risks or those with high inherent uncertainty. The key is demonstrating a systematic, rigorous process.

**How does climate risk assessment relate to our transition plan?**

They are complementary. The climate risk assessment identifies risks and opportunities; the transition plan articulates your strategy for managing them. A credible transition plan must be informed by scenario analysis and risk assessment. Together, they demonstrate that your net-zero commitments are grounded in an understanding of the risks and opportunities the transition creates.
