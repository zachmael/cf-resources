## Overview

The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) adopted its final climate-related disclosure rules in March 2024, marking the most significant expansion of mandatory corporate disclosure in the United States in decades. The rules amend Regulation S-K and Regulation S-X to require registrants to disclose material climate-related risks, governance processes, risk management activities, GHG emissions, and the financial statement effects of severe weather events and other natural conditions.

The final rules were significantly scaled back from the March 2022 proposal. Most notably, the SEC removed the mandatory Scope 3 emissions disclosure requirement and narrowed the Scope 1 and 2 reporting obligations to large accelerated filers (LAFs) and accelerated filers (AFs), subject to a materiality qualifier for AFs. The rules also incorporated a phased timeline and limited assurance requirements.

The rules have faced legal challenges. In April 2024, the SEC voluntarily stayed the rules pending judicial review by the Eighth Circuit Court of Appeals. As of early 2026, the litigation remains ongoing, creating regulatory uncertainty. However, many companies are proceeding with implementation planning, recognizing that climate disclosure mandates—whether through the SEC, state laws like California's SB 253, or international frameworks—are increasingly unavoidable.

## Who Does It Apply To?

The rules apply to SEC registrants—domestic issuers and foreign private issuers that file annual reports with the SEC. The requirements are phased by filer category:

**Large Accelerated Filers (LAFs):** Public float ≥ $700 million. Subject to the most comprehensive requirements including Scope 1 and 2 emissions disclosure with third-party assurance.

**Accelerated Filers (AFs):** Public float $75M–$700M. Required to disclose Scope 1 and 2 emissions only if material, with limited assurance.

**Non-Accelerated Filers, Smaller Reporting Companies (SRCs), and Emerging Growth Companies (EGCs):** Subject to qualitative disclosure requirements (governance, strategy, risk management) but exempt from quantitative GHG emissions disclosure.

**Foreign Private Issuers (FPIs):** Subject to the same requirements as domestic registrants in their applicable filer category.

## Key Requirements

**1. Governance Disclosures (Reg S-K)**
Describe the board's oversight of climate-related risks, including identification of responsible board members or committees, their expertise, and how frequently they are informed. Describe management's role in assessing and managing material climate-related risks.

**2. Strategy and Risk Management (Reg S-K)**
Describe material climate-related risks, categorized as physical or transition risks, and the time horizons over which they may manifest. Disclose the actual and potential material impacts on strategy, business model, and outlook. If the registrant uses scenario analysis, describe the scenarios, assumptions, and financial impacts. Disclose any transition plans and how they are managed.

**3. GHG Emissions (Reg S-K)**
LAFs must disclose Scope 1 and Scope 2 GHG emissions. AFs must disclose Scope 1 and 2 only if material. Emissions must be expressed in absolute terms (metric tons CO₂e) and disaggregated by constituent greenhouse gas if individually material. Scope 3 reporting is not required. Emissions data must be reported for the fiscal year covered by the filing.

**4. Attestation (Assurance)**
LAFs must obtain limited assurance over Scope 1 and 2 emissions, transitioning to reasonable assurance in later years. AFs are required to obtain limited assurance. Attestation providers must meet independence, competence, and oversight requirements specified in the rules. The attestation report must be filed with the SEC.

**5. Financial Statement Disclosures (Reg S-X)**
In a note to the audited financial statements, registrants must disclose the financial statement effects of severe weather events and other natural conditions if the aggregate impact exceeds 1% of the relevant financial statement line item. This includes costs and losses, capitalized costs, charges, and recoveries. Registrants must also disclose expenditures related to carbon offsets and renewable energy certificates (RECs) if material.

**6. Targets and Goals**
If a registrant has set climate-related targets or goals that have materially affected or are reasonably likely to materially affect its business, results of or financial condition, it must disclose those targets, progress toward them, and how they are being achieved. This includes the use of offsets and RECs.

## Step-by-Step Compliance Roadmap

### Step 1: Determine Filer Category and Scope

Confirm your SEC filer category and identify which requirements apply. Map the phased compliance timeline to your fiscal year. Determine whether any subsidiaries or acquired entities create additional reporting complexity. Even if the rules remain stayed, this scoping exercise is valuable preparation.

### Step 2: Materiality Assessment for Climate Risks

Conduct a rigorous materiality assessment of climate-related risks using the SEC's established materiality standard (information a reasonable investor would consider important). This assessment should cover physical risks (acute and chronic) and transition risks (regulatory, market, technology, reputation). Document your methodology—the SEC expects the same analytical rigor applied to other material risk assessments.

### Step 3: Build Emissions Measurement Capabilities

Establish or enhance GHG emissions inventory processes for Scope 1 and 2 in accordance with the GHG Protocol or a comparable methodology. Define organizational and operational boundaries. Implement data collection systems, calculation methodologies, and quality controls. Even AFs should build these capabilities, as materiality of emissions may change over time.

### Step 4: Prepare Disclosures

Draft governance, strategy, and risk management disclosures for Reg S-K filings. Prepare the Reg S-X financial statement note, including tracking systems for severe weather event costs. Quantify GHG emissions for the reporting period. Ensure consistency between climate disclosures and other sections of the annual report. Review with legal counsel for liability considerations.

### Step 5: Engage Attestation Providers

Select an attestation provider that meets the SEC's independence and competence requirements. Engage them early to align on scope, methodology, and timeline. Build internal controls and documentation with attestation requirements in mind. Phase in assurance readiness even before the formal assurance requirement takes effect.

## Common Pitfalls

**Treating the stay as a reason to pause preparation.** The litigation creates timing uncertainty, not directional uncertainty. Climate disclosure mandates are coming through multiple channels (SEC, state laws, international frameworks). Companies that defer preparation will face compressed timelines when the rules take effect or equivalents emerge.

**Applying ESG materiality rather than SEC materiality.** The SEC climate rules use the traditional securities law materiality standard—what a reasonable investor would find important in making investment decisions. This is distinct from impact materiality or double materiality concepts used in other frameworks. Applying the wrong materiality lens leads to either over-disclosure or under-disclosure.

**Underestimating Reg S-X requirements.** The financial statement note on severe weather event effects is audited, meaning it falls under existing financial audit requirements. Companies without systems to track and aggregate climate-related costs across operations will find this requirement particularly challenging.

**Inconsistent disclosures across filings.** The SEC will compare climate disclosures in the annual report with statements in earnings calls, investor presentations, and sustainability reports. Inconsistencies create enforcement risk. Ensure a consistent narrative across all communications channels.

## Frequently Asked Questions

### Are Scope 3 emissions required under the SEC rules?

No. The final rules removed the proposed Scope 3 disclosure requirement. Companies are not required to disclose Scope 3 emissions under the SEC climate rules. However, if a registrant has set a climate-related target that includes Scope 3 emissions, and that target is material to the business, the registrant must disclose relevant information about the target, which may indirectly involve Scope 3 data.

### How does the SEC rule interact with California's SB 253 and SB 261?

California's SB 253 (Climate Corporate Data Accountability Act) requires companies with over $1 billion in annual revenue doing business in California to report Scope 1, 2, and 3 emissions. SB 261 requires companies with over $500 million in revenue to report on climate-related financial risks. These state laws operate independently of the SEC rules and apply to both public and private companies meeting the thresholds. Companies subject to both must plan for overlapping but distinct requirements.

### What attestation standard applies to GHG emissions assurance?

The SEC rules do not prescribe a specific attestation standard but require the provider to use standards and procedures that are publicly available and established by a body with oversight processes. In practice, most attestation engagements will use AICPA attestation standards, ISO 14064-3, or the IAASB's ISSA 5000. The attestation provider must be independent and the attestation report must be filed with the SEC.

### Can we use carbon offsets to reduce disclosed emissions?

No. GHG emissions must be reported gross of any offset or REC purchases. If you use offsets or RECs, you must separately disclose the amount, type, source, and certification of those instruments. The SEC's approach is clear: offsets are not a substitute for emissions reduction, and investors need to see both the gross emissions and the offset strategy.
