## Overview

Stakeholder engagement sits at the heart of credible sustainability strategy. Under CSRD's double materiality framework, companies must consider the perspectives of affected stakeholders — employees, communities, customers, investors, suppliers, and civil society — when determining which sustainability topics are material. This isn't a bureaucratic checkbox; it's a strategic process that shapes what you report, what you prioritize, and how effectively your sustainability program addresses real-world impacts.

The expectation has evolved considerably beyond annual surveys and token advisory panels. ESRS 1 (General Requirements) specifies that the double materiality assessment must involve engagement with affected stakeholders, and that the outcomes must be documented and auditable. The ISSB standards, while more investor-focused, also require companies to understand the sustainability-related risks and opportunities that matter to providers of financial capital. GRI's Universal Standards have long required stakeholder inclusiveness as a foundational reporting principle.

Organizations that approach stakeholder engagement strategically gain intelligence that desk research alone cannot provide — early warning signals on emerging risks, operational insights from frontline workers, community perspectives that prevent project delays, and investor priorities that shape capital allocation.

## Who Does It Apply To?

- **CSRD-reporting entities** — double materiality assessment requires stakeholder engagement as a defined input
- **GRI reporters** — GRI 2-29 requires disclosure of stakeholder engagement approach and outcomes
- **Companies conducting environmental and social impact assessments** — EIA/ESIA processes typically mandate affected community consultation
- **Infrastructure and extractive projects** subject to free, prior, and informed consent (FPIC) requirements under IFC Performance Standards
- **Financial institutions** engaging with portfolio companies on ESG performance (stewardship codes, PRI obligations)
- **Organizations undertaking major strategic shifts** — energy transition, site closures, supply chain restructuring — where stakeholder impacts are significant
- **Any company seeking to strengthen the credibility and relevance of its sustainability disclosures**

## Key Requirements

1. **Identify and map your stakeholders** — both affected stakeholders (those impacted by your operations) and users of sustainability information (investors, lenders, regulators). Distinguish between those with direct relationships and those reached through proxies or representatives.

2. **Design engagement processes proportionate to the topic and stakeholder group.** Methods range from surveys and interviews to workshops, focus groups, community meetings, advisory panels, and ongoing digital platforms. Match the method to the context.

3. **Integrate engagement into double materiality assessment.** Under ESRS, stakeholder perspectives inform the identification and prioritization of material sustainability topics from both impact and financial materiality dimensions.

4. **Document the process and outcomes** in sufficient detail for assurance. Record who was engaged, how, when, on what topics, and how their input influenced materiality determinations and strategic priorities.

5. **Establish feedback mechanisms** so stakeholders can see how their input was used. This builds trust and encourages continued participation. One-way data extraction without follow-up is both ethically questionable and practically counterproductive.

6. **Conduct engagement regularly, not just at reporting time.** Continuous or periodic engagement produces more meaningful insights than annual surveys timed to the reporting calendar.

7. **Address power imbalances and accessibility.** Vulnerable or marginalized stakeholders may face barriers to participation. Design processes that accommodate language differences, digital access limitations, cultural norms, and fear of retaliation.

## Timeline & Milestones

**Months 1–2: Stakeholder Mapping & Planning**
Identify all relevant stakeholder groups. Assess their interest, influence, and potential impact exposure. Design an engagement plan specifying objectives, methods, timelines, and resource requirements for each group.

**Months 3–5: Primary Engagement Activities**
Execute the engagement plan — surveys, interviews, workshops, community meetings, investor dialogues. For double materiality assessments, focus on understanding which sustainability topics stakeholders consider most significant from both impact and financial perspectives.

**Months 6–7: Analysis & Integration**
Synthesize engagement findings. Map stakeholder perspectives to your materiality matrix. Identify areas of convergence and divergence between stakeholder groups. Document how engagement outcomes influenced materiality determinations.

**Months 8–9: Strategy Response & Communication**
Develop or update sustainability strategy priorities based on engagement findings. Communicate back to stakeholders how their input shaped your approach — this closes the loop and builds credibility.

**Months 10–12: Ongoing Dialogue & Monitoring**
Establish ongoing engagement channels for priority stakeholder groups. Monitor stakeholder sentiment and emerging issues. Feed insights into risk management and strategic planning processes.

## Step-by-Step Compliance Roadmap

### Step 1: Map Your Stakeholder Universe

Create a comprehensive stakeholder map organized by relationship type:

- **Internal:** Employees (including contract workers), management, board members, works councils/unions
- **Value chain:** Suppliers, customers, distributors, joint venture partners
- **Financial:** Investors, lenders, insurers, credit rating agencies
- **Community:** Local residents, indigenous peoples, community organizations, local government
- **Civil society:** NGOs, advocacy groups, academic institutions, media
- **Regulatory:** Regulators, standard-setters, industry associations

For each group, assess: (a) how they are affected by your operations, (b) how they can affect your business, (c) what sustainability topics are most relevant to them, and (d) the most effective engagement methods.

### Step 2: Design Fit-for-Purpose Engagement

Different stakeholders require different approaches:

- **Employees:** Pulse surveys, town halls, works council consultations, anonymous feedback channels
- **Investors:** One-on-one meetings, ESG roadshows, proxy season engagement, CDP and questionnaire responses
- **Communities:** Public meetings, participatory workshops, local advisory panels, partnering with community organizations as intermediaries
- **Suppliers:** Supplier days, capacity-building workshops, joint sustainability initiatives
- **NGOs and civil society:** Formal partnerships, multi-stakeholder initiatives, expert advisory panels

For double materiality specifically, structured workshops with representative stakeholders — using consistent facilitation methodology — produce the most defensible outcomes. Supplement with broader surveys for statistical validity.

### Step 3: Execute with Rigour

Run engagement activities with clear protocols: informed consent, confidentiality commitments where appropriate, professional facilitation, and systematic documentation. For community engagement in sensitive contexts (land use, environmental impacts, indigenous rights), ensure alignment with IFC Performance Standards and FPIC requirements.

Record all engagement activities in a centralized log including: date, participants (anonymized where necessary), topics discussed, key findings, and follow-up commitments.

### Step 4: Synthesize and Integrate

Analyze engagement findings systematically, not anecdotally. Identify recurring themes, points of consensus, and areas of disagreement. Weight inputs appropriately — a community directly affected by your operations may have different standing than a distant industry association, and your materiality assessment should reflect this.

Map findings to your double materiality matrix. For each potential material topic, document the stakeholder evidence supporting its inclusion or exclusion. This documentation is essential for CSRD assurance.

### Step 5: Close the Loop

Report back to stakeholders on how their input was used. This can take many forms: published materiality assessment results, direct communication to advisory panel members, community newsletters, or investor briefings. Explain where you acted on feedback and where you took a different direction — and why.

Closing the loop transforms stakeholder engagement from an extractive research exercise into a trust-building relationship. Organizations that do this well find that stakeholder willingness to participate increases over time, improving data quality and strategic relevance.

## Common Pitfalls

**Engaging stakeholders after decisions are made.** If materiality determinations, strategy priorities, or project designs are finalized before engagement occurs, the process is performative. Stakeholders can tell — and will disengage. Schedule engagement early enough that input genuinely shapes outcomes.

**Over-relying on surveys.** Online surveys are efficient for reaching large populations but produce shallow insights on complex sustainability topics. Combine surveys with qualitative methods (interviews, workshops, focus groups) for depth and nuance.

**Ignoring hard-to-reach stakeholders.** Affected communities, migrant workers, smallholder farmers in supply chains, and indigenous peoples are often the most impacted and least heard. Designing accessible engagement requires extra effort — local language translation, in-person presence, trusted intermediaries — but their perspectives are often the most material.

**Treating engagement as a sustainability team activity.** Investor engagement is led by IR, employee engagement by HR, community engagement by site management, and customer engagement by marketing. The sustainability team should coordinate and synthesize, but effective engagement happens through existing relationships, not parallel channels.

We help clients design ongoing engagement structures — advisory panels, digital platforms, annual engagement cycles — that build sustained relationships rather than one-off interactions.

We also support organizations navigating sensitive engagement contexts: FPIC processes, post-incident community relations, contested project environments, and multi-stakeholder initiatives where competing interests require skilled facilitation.

## FAQs

**How many stakeholders do we need to engage for CSRD compliance?**

ESRS does not prescribe a minimum number. The expectation is that engagement is representative and proportionate — covering key affected stakeholder groups relevant to your material topics. For a typical large company, this might involve hundreds of survey respondents, dozens of interview subjects, and several workshop sessions. Quality and representativeness matter more than volume.

**Can we use proxies instead of engaging affected stakeholders directly?**

Yes, where direct engagement is impractical. ESRS acknowledges that engaging directly with all affected stakeholders (e.g., workers deep in the supply chain) may not be feasible. In these cases, proxies — trade unions, NGOs, community representatives, academic experts — can serve as intermediaries. Document why direct engagement was not possible and how you selected credible proxies.

**How do we handle conflicting stakeholder views?**

Conflicting perspectives are normal and expected. Your role is not to achieve consensus but to understand the range of views, assess their relevance to materiality, and make informed decisions. Document the divergence, explain how you weighed competing perspectives, and be transparent about the trade-offs in your reporting.

**Is stakeholder engagement required for ISSB reporting?**

IFRS S1 and S2 do not prescribe stakeholder engagement in the same way as ESRS. However, understanding the information needs of investors and lenders requires dialogue, and emerging practice under ISSB reporting increasingly incorporates stakeholder perspectives. Companies reporting under both CSRD and ISSB can design a single engagement process that serves both.
