## Overview

Net-zero has become the defining climate commitment of the decade. Over 9,000 companies globally have set or committed to science-based targets, and investors managing more than $130 trillion in assets are asking portfolio companies to demonstrate credible decarbonization pathways. The term itself has been sharpened considerably: ISO's Net Zero Guidelines (IWA 42:2022) and the Science Based Targets initiative's Corporate Net-Zero Standard define net-zero as reducing value chain emissions by 90–95% from a base year, with only residual emissions (5–10%) neutralized through permanent carbon dioxide removals.

This is fundamentally different from carbon neutrality. Net-zero cannot be purchased — it must be engineered through structural changes to energy systems, supply chains, product design, and business models. The timeline is specific: SBTi requires near-term targets (5–10 years) demonstrating rapid emissions cuts, and long-term targets reaching net-zero by 2050 or sooner.

For organizations beginning this journey, the gap between current emissions trajectories and net-zero can feel insurmountable. It isn't — but it requires honest assessment, strategic investment, and sustained execution over decades. Companies that start now gain first-mover advantages in technology adoption, talent attraction, and capital access.

## Who Does It Apply To?

- **SBTi-committed companies** — over 4,000 companies have validated science-based targets, with the Net-Zero Standard setting requirements for long-term commitments
- **CSRD-reporting entities** required to disclose transition plans under ESRS E1, including alignment with 1.5°C pathways
- **UK-listed companies** subject to Transition Plan Taskforce (TPT) disclosure expectations
- **Financial institutions** subject to NZBA, NZAOA, or NZAMI commitments under the Glasgow Financial Alliance for Net Zero
- **Companies with CDP A-list ambitions** — CDP's scoring increasingly rewards credible net-zero strategies
- **Government contractors** in jurisdictions with public procurement decarbonization requirements (EU, UK, Canada)
- **Any organization making public net-zero pledges** — regulatory and litigation risk attaches to unsubstantiated claims

## Key Requirements

1. **Set near-term science-based targets** for Scope 1, 2, and material Scope 3 categories, aligned with 1.5°C pathways using SBTi-approved methodologies (absolute contraction or sectoral decarbonization).

2. **Set a long-term net-zero target** achieving at least 90% reduction in total value chain emissions from base year levels by 2050 or sooner.

3. **Develop a detailed transition plan** outlining decarbonization levers, capital requirements, technology dependencies, and interim milestones at 5-year intervals.

4. **Address residual emissions** through a strategy for permanent carbon dioxide removal (CDR) — not avoidance offsets. Acceptable CDR methods include direct air capture with storage (DACS), biochar, and enhanced weathering.

5. **Integrate climate considerations into governance** — board oversight, executive incentive structures, and capital allocation processes must reflect net-zero commitments.

6. **Report progress annually** against near-term and long-term targets, including absolute emissions, intensity metrics, and progress on transition plan milestones.

7. **Avoid over-reliance on carbon credits** for near-term target achievement. SBTi's Beyond Value Chain Mitigation guidance encourages credit purchases as supplementary climate finance, not as substitutes for direct reductions.

## Timeline & Milestones

**Year 1: Foundation**
Complete comprehensive GHG inventory (Scopes 1, 2, and material Scope 3). Set base year. Model emission reduction pathways using sector-specific decarbonization scenarios. Submit near-term targets to SBTi for validation.

**Years 2–3: Quick Wins & Infrastructure**
Implement high-impact, lower-cost measures: renewable electricity procurement (PPAs, on-site solar), energy efficiency retrofits, LED lighting, HVAC optimization. Transition fleet vehicles to electric where infrastructure permits. Launch supplier engagement program for Scope 3 hotspots.

**Years 4–7: Structural Transformation**
Address harder-to-abate areas: process heat electrification, green hydrogen for industrial applications, logistics optimization, product redesign for lower use-phase emissions. Invest in R&D for sector-specific decarbonization technologies. Deepen supply chain decarbonization through preferential procurement and capacity building.

**Years 8–15: Deep Decarbonization**
Achieve 50%+ absolute reduction from base year. Scale adoption of breakthrough technologies as they mature (sustainable aviation fuel, carbon capture, low-carbon materials). Restructure business models where necessary to align with low-carbon markets.

**Years 15–25: Residual Emissions & Net-Zero**
Reach 90–95% reduction. Secure permanent carbon removal capacity (via DACS contracts, biochar projects, or equivalent) for residual emissions. Achieve and maintain net-zero status with annual verification.

## Step-by-Step Compliance Roadmap

### Step 1: Establish Governance & Accountability

Assign board-level oversight for climate strategy. Designate a senior executive (CSO, CFO, or COO) as the accountable owner of the net-zero target. Embed climate KPIs into executive compensation — research shows companies with climate-linked incentives achieve 15–20% faster emissions reductions.

Establish a cross-functional climate steering committee with representation from operations, finance, procurement, product development, and legal. Net-zero is an enterprise-wide transformation, not a sustainability department project.

### Step 2: Model Decarbonization Pathways

Use scenario analysis to map potential decarbonization trajectories. Key variables include electricity grid decarbonization rates, technology maturity timelines (green hydrogen, CCUS, sustainable fuels), carbon price assumptions, and demand-side changes.

Build a marginal abatement cost curve (MACC) ranking reduction opportunities by cost per tonne of CO2e avoided. This reveals which measures deliver the most impact per dollar — and where significant capital investment will be required.

### Step 3: Develop the Transition Plan

Translate pathway analysis into an actionable transition plan with:
- Specific decarbonization initiatives by business unit and emission source
- Capital expenditure requirements and funding sources
- Technology adoption milestones and contingency plans
- Workforce implications (reskilling, new roles, phase-outs)
- Policy engagement strategy aligned with net-zero objectives

Align with the TPT Disclosure Framework for structure and content, regardless of whether TPT reporting is mandatory for your organization.

### Step 4: Execute and Track

Implement the plan in phased waves, prioritizing measures with the best combination of emissions impact, financial return, and strategic value. Establish quarterly tracking against annual targets. Build internal carbon pricing into capital allocation decisions — shadow prices of $50–100/tCO2e are common among leading companies.

Report progress through existing disclosure channels (CSRD, CDP, annual report) with honest assessment of what's on track and what's lagging. Investors and stakeholders respect transparency about challenges far more than cherry-picked success stories.

### Step 5: Prepare for Residual Emissions

Begin planning for permanent carbon removal well before you reach net-zero. CDR capacity is limited and demand is growing rapidly — advance purchase agreements for DACS credits or investment in removal project development can secure supply. Current DACS costs range from $400–1,000/tonne but are projected to decline to $100–300/tonne by the mid-2030s as the industry scales.

## Common Pitfalls

**Setting targets without transition plans.** A net-zero target without a roadmap is a press release, not a strategy. Investors, regulators, and the SBTi are all demanding credible implementation plans behind the numbers. If you can't explain how you'll get from here to net-zero, the target lacks meaning.

**Underestimating Scope 3 complexity.** Most companies' Scope 3 emissions are 5–20x larger than their operational footprint. Net-zero is impossible without engaging your value chain — yet many organizations treat Scope 3 as a data problem rather than a strategic challenge requiring supplier partnerships, product innovation, and business model evolution.

**Conflating carbon neutrality with net-zero.** They are different commitments with different requirements. Using the terms interchangeably — or claiming net-zero through offsets alone — creates regulatory and reputational risk. Be precise in language and ensure your communications team understands the distinction.

**Ignoring transition risks and opportunities.** Net-zero strategy should be integrated with financial planning and enterprise risk management. The organizations that thrive in a decarbonizing economy are those that identify new revenue streams, market positioning, and operational efficiencies alongside their emissions reductions.

## FAQs

**How is net-zero different from carbon neutrality?**

Carbon neutrality can be achieved today by offsetting current emissions with carbon credits. Net-zero requires deep decarbonization — typically 90–95% reduction from baseline — before neutralizing only the small residual with permanent carbon removals. Net-zero is a structural transformation; carbon neutrality is a transactional one.

**What does SBTi require for a net-zero target?**

SBTi requires both near-term targets (5–10 year horizon, aligned with 1.5°C) and a long-term net-zero target (by 2050 at the latest). The long-term target must achieve at least 90% reduction across Scopes 1, 2, and 3. Residual emissions must be neutralized through permanent removals, not avoidance credits. Companies must also demonstrate progress through annual reporting.

**Can we use carbon credits toward our net-zero target?**

Not for near-term targets. SBTi explicitly prohibits using carbon credits to count toward near-term emissions reductions. For the long-term target, only permanent carbon dioxide removals (not avoidance credits) can neutralize residual emissions. SBTi does encourage Beyond Value Chain Mitigation — purchasing credits as supplementary climate finance — but these don't count toward target achievement.

**What if our sector lacks decarbonization technology?**

Some sectors (cement, steel, aviation, shipping) face genuine technological barriers. SBTi's sectoral pathways account for this with sector-specific reduction rates. The key is demonstrating that you're pursuing every available lever, investing in R&D, and engaging in pre-competitive collaboration to accelerate solutions. Waiting for perfect technology is not a credible strategy.
