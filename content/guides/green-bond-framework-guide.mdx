## Overview

Green bonds have become a cornerstone of sustainable finance, channelling capital toward projects with environmental benefits. Global green bond issuance surpassed $575 billion in 2023 and continues to grow as governments, corporates, and financial institutions seek to fund climate and environmental objectives. The market has matured substantially since the first green bond in 2007, with increasingly rigorous standards governing what qualifies.

The EU Green Bond Standard (EU GBS), which entered into force in December 2024, establishes the most demanding voluntary framework to date — requiring that proceeds fund activities aligned with the EU Taxonomy and that issuers obtain external verification. The ICMA Green Bond Principles (GBP), updated regularly since 2014, remain the market standard globally, providing flexible guidance on use of proceeds, project evaluation, proceeds management, and reporting.

For issuers, a credible green bond framework unlocks pricing advantages (the "greenium" — typically 2–10 basis points), diversifies the investor base toward ESG-mandated funds, and signals strategic commitment to sustainability. For the framework to deliver these benefits, however, it must withstand scrutiny from investors, second-party opinion providers, and increasingly, regulators.

## Who Does It Apply To?

- **Corporates seeking to finance sustainability-related capital expenditures** — renewable energy, energy efficiency, clean transportation, green buildings, water management, pollution prevention
- **Sovereign and sub-sovereign issuers** funding national climate and environmental programs
- **Municipalities and public agencies** financing green infrastructure — transit, water systems, energy, waste management
- **Financial institutions** issuing green bonds to fund qualifying loan portfolios
- **Real estate companies** financing green building construction or retrofit programs
- **Utilities** funding renewable energy generation, grid modernization, and energy storage
- **Any organization considering EU Green Bond Standard designation** for bonds placed with European investors

## Key Requirements

1. **Define eligible green project categories** aligned with recognized taxonomies. Under ICMA GBP, categories are flexible but must deliver clear environmental benefits. Under EU GBS, activities must be Taxonomy-aligned with substantial contribution to at least one environmental objective and "do no significant harm" to others.

2. **Establish a project evaluation and selection process** with defined ESG criteria, governance structures, and procedures for identifying and approving eligible projects.

3. **Implement proceeds management** — track and allocate bond proceeds to eligible projects, typically through a dedicated sub-portfolio or earmarking system. Unallocated proceeds must be held in temporary investments consistent with the framework.

4. **Commit to annual allocation reporting** detailing the distribution of proceeds across eligible categories, including unallocated amounts.

5. **Commit to impact reporting** quantifying the environmental benefits of funded projects using recognized metrics (tonnes CO2e avoided, MWh renewable energy generated, m² green building certified, ML water saved).

6. **Obtain an external review** — a second-party opinion (SPO) from a recognized provider (Sustainalytics, ISS ESG, Cicero, V.E.) confirming framework alignment with ICMA GBP. Under EU GBS, registered external reviewers must verify Taxonomy alignment.

7. **Ensure coherence with corporate sustainability strategy** — the framework should be consistent with your broader climate commitments, transition plans, and sustainability disclosures.

## Timeline & Milestones

**Months 1–2: Strategic Assessment**
Evaluate your pipeline of eligible green projects. Assess whether the volume and quality of projects justify a green bond issuance. Consider timing relative to your capital markets strategy and investor demand.

**Months 3–4: Framework Development**
Draft the green bond framework: eligible categories, project evaluation criteria, proceeds management approach, and reporting commitments. Benchmark against peer issuers in your sector.

**Month 5: External Review**
Engage a second-party opinion provider. The SPO process typically takes 4–6 weeks, including document review, issuer discussions, and opinion drafting. Address any concerns raised before publication.

**Month 6: Issuance Preparation**
Finalize legal documentation, engage underwriters, prepare investor materials, and incorporate the green bond framework into roadshow presentations.

**Post-Issuance: Ongoing Reporting**
Publish annual allocation and impact reports until full allocation. Maintain records and controls supporting the claims made in each report.

## Step-by-Step Compliance Roadmap

### Step 1: Identify Eligible Projects

Review your capital expenditure pipeline and existing asset portfolio for projects that deliver measurable environmental benefits. Common eligible categories include:

- **Renewable energy:** Solar, wind, hydroelectric, geothermal generation and storage
- **Energy efficiency:** Building retrofits, industrial process improvements, smart grid technology
- **Clean transportation:** Electric vehicle fleet, public transit infrastructure, cycling infrastructure
- **Green buildings:** New construction or renovation meeting LEED Gold+, BREEAM Excellent+, or equivalent
- **Water management:** Wastewater treatment, water efficiency, sustainable water supply
- **Pollution prevention:** Emissions reduction equipment, circular economy initiatives, waste-to-energy
- **Biodiversity:** Ecosystem restoration, sustainable land use, conservation

For EU GBS designation, each project must map to a Taxonomy-eligible economic activity with documented compliance against technical screening criteria and DNSH requirements.

### Step 2: Design Governance and Selection Process

Establish a Green Bond Committee (or equivalent) with representation from treasury, sustainability, and relevant business units. This committee evaluates and approves eligible projects, ensures compliance with framework criteria, and oversees ongoing monitoring.

Define clear selection criteria: environmental eligibility, minimum impact thresholds, exclusionary screens (e.g., no fossil fuel projects), and alignment with corporate sustainability targets. Document the decision-making process for audit trail purposes.

### Step 3: Structure Proceeds Management

Design a system to track the allocation of bond proceeds to eligible projects. Options include:

- **Earmarking approach:** Track proceeds in a dedicated internal account or sub-portfolio
- **Portfolio approach:** Maintain a portfolio of eligible assets at least equal to the outstanding bond amount

Specify the treatment of unallocated proceeds — typically invested in cash equivalents, money market instruments, or green-labeled investments. Under EU GBS, a detailed allocation plan must be provided at issuance.

### Step 4: Secure External Review

Select an SPO provider based on sector expertise, market credibility, and analytical approach. Provide the provider with your framework, eligible project pipeline, sustainability strategy, and supporting documentation. The SPO will assess:

- Alignment with ICMA GBP core components
- Environmental credibility of eligible categories
- Robustness of governance and selection processes
- Coherence with corporate sustainability commitments
- Any controversial activities or ESG risks

Address any "medium" or "dark green" shading shortfalls through framework revisions or additional commitments.

### Step 5: Report Transparently

Publish annual reports covering:

- **Allocation report:** Proceeds allocated by category, project descriptions, geographic distribution, and unallocated balance
- **Impact report:** Quantified environmental outcomes using ex-ante estimates or actual measured impacts — CO2e avoided, renewable energy generated, water saved, waste diverted, buildings certified

Use the ICMA Harmonized Framework for Impact Reporting as a template. Where possible, have impact data independently verified. Investors increasingly expect impact reports to be assured or at minimum, reviewed by a third party.

## Common Pitfalls

**Defining overly broad eligible categories.** Categories like "environmental projects" without specific criteria invite greenwashing accusations. Investors and SPO providers expect precise definitions with clear environmental thresholds and exclusions.

**Issuing without a credible sustainability strategy.** A green bond framework that exists in isolation from broader corporate climate commitments raises red flags. Investors will question why a company issues green bonds while expanding fossil fuel operations or lacking emissions reduction targets.

**Weak impact reporting.** Allocation reports that track where money went are necessary but insufficient. Investors want to see environmental outcomes — and they're getting more sophisticated about distinguishing genuine impact from business-as-usual spending rebranded as green.

**Ignoring EU GBS implications.** Even if you don't seek EU GBS designation, European investors will increasingly benchmark your framework against it. Understanding where your framework aligns and diverges from EU GBS prepares you for investor questions and future market evolution.

We've worked with corporate, municipal, and financial institution issuers to design frameworks that meet the highest market standards.

Our team combines sustainability expertise with capital markets knowledge, ensuring that frameworks are both environmentally credible and commercially effective. We help navigate the complexity of EU Taxonomy alignment for EU GBS designation and design impact reporting methodologies that deliver meaningful data to investors.

We also support repeat issuers in maintaining and updating their frameworks as standards evolve, ensuring that each new issuance builds on an increasingly robust green financing track record.

## FAQs

**What is the "greenium" and how large is it?**

The greenium is the pricing advantage green bonds enjoy over conventional bonds from the same issuer — reflecting excess investor demand for green-labeled instruments. Studies consistently show a greenium of 2–10 basis points in the primary market, though it varies by issuer quality, market conditions, and framework credibility. For large issuances, even a small greenium represents meaningful savings.

**Do we need EU GBS designation?**

Not necessarily. ICMA GBP-aligned frameworks remain fully acceptable in the market and are used by the majority of green bond issuers globally. EU GBS is voluntary and adds significant requirements (Taxonomy alignment, registered external reviewer, granular allocation plan). Consider EU GBS if your investor base is heavily European and your eligible projects readily align with the Taxonomy.

**Can we include existing assets or only new projects?**

Both. Refinancing existing green assets is permitted under ICMA GBP, typically with a lookback period (commonly 2–3 years). Investors prefer a mix of new projects and recent refinancings. Refinancing very old projects with limited remaining useful life may draw scrutiny.

**How often must we report?**

Annual reporting is standard market practice and required under most frameworks. Publish allocation reports annually until proceeds are fully allocated, and impact reports for the life of the bond or until all funded projects are complete. Some issuers provide interim updates semi-annually.
