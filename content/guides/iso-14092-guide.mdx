## Overview

ISO 14092:2020 provides a framework for adaptation planning for local governments and communities, addressing the growing need for systematic approaches to climate change adaptation at the subnational level. Published in December 2020 as part of the ISO 14090 family of adaptation standards, ISO 14092 fills a critical gap by providing detailed guidance tailored specifically to the challenges and governance structures of local authorities.

The standard sits within a broader family: ISO 14090:2019 provides the overarching principles and framework for adaptation, ISO 14091:2021 covers vulnerability, impacts, and risk assessment, and ISO 14092 focuses on local government adaptation planning. Together, these standards provide an end-to-end framework that moves communities from climate risk understanding through structured adaptation action.

Climate adaptation at the local level is no longer optional. Cities and communities face escalating physical climate risks—flooding, heat waves, sea level rise, drought, wildfire—that demand coordinated planning and investment. ISO 14092 provides the structured approach that enables local governments to move from ad hoc responses to systematic, prioritized, and monitored adaptation strategies. While designed for local governments, the framework's principles are equally valuable for regional authorities, utilities, and private sector organizations managing place-based climate risks.

## Who Does It Apply To?

ISO 14092 is designed primarily for **local governments and communities**, but its framework is relevant to a broader set of organizations:

- **Municipal and city governments** developing climate adaptation plans
- **Regional and county authorities** coordinating adaptation across jurisdictions
- **Utilities and infrastructure operators** (water, energy, transportation) managing climate-sensitive assets
- **Port authorities and coastal management agencies** addressing sea level rise and storm surge
- **Private sector organizations** with significant place-based physical climate risks
- **Development agencies and multilateral institutions** supporting adaptation planning in developing countries
- **Community organizations and Indigenous groups** engaged in local resilience planning

The standard is particularly valuable for organizations subject to national adaptation planning requirements—many countries now require or strongly encourage local climate adaptation plans, and ISO 14092 provides a recognized methodology for developing them.

## Key Requirements

**1. Understanding the Local Context**
Assess the local government's functions, responsibilities, and geographic and socioeconomic context. Identify existing plans, policies, and programs that relate to adaptation. Understand the governance structures, stakeholder landscape, and available resources. This contextual foundation ensures the adaptation plan is grounded in local reality.

**2. Climate Impact and Vulnerability Assessment**
Assess current and projected climate hazards relevant to the locality. Evaluate the vulnerability of community systems (infrastructure, ecosystems, social systems, economic activities) to these hazards. The assessment should consider both current climate variability and future climate projections across multiple timeframes and emissions scenarios.

**3. Risk Prioritization**
Prioritize climate risks based on their likelihood, consequence, urgency, and the adaptive capacity of affected systems. Not all risks can be addressed simultaneously—prioritization ensures that limited resources are directed toward the most critical vulnerabilities. Involve stakeholders in the prioritization process to incorporate diverse perspectives and local knowledge.

**4. Adaptation Options Identification and Evaluation**
Identify a range of potential adaptation options for priority risks. Options may include infrastructure modifications, policy changes, ecosystem-based adaptation, capacity building, early warning systems, and spatial planning adjustments. Evaluate options against criteria including effectiveness, feasibility, cost-benefit, co-benefits, and potential maladaptation risks.

**5. Implementation Planning**
Develop an implementation plan that specifies actions, responsible parties, timelines, resource requirements, and funding mechanisms. Integrate adaptation actions into existing planning processes (land use planning, infrastructure investment, emergency management) wherever possible—standalone adaptation plans that are not embedded in mainstream governance structures tend to stall.

**6. Monitoring, Evaluation, and Learning**
Establish monitoring and evaluation frameworks to track implementation progress and adaptation outcomes. Define indicators and reporting mechanisms. Build in review cycles that allow the adaptation plan to be updated as climate science evolves, new risks emerge, and implemented actions deliver lessons.

**7. Stakeholder Engagement**
Engage stakeholders throughout the planning process—from risk assessment through implementation and monitoring. ISO 14092 emphasizes inclusive engagement that incorporates the perspectives of vulnerable populations, Indigenous communities, businesses, and civil society organizations.

## Step-by-Step Compliance Roadmap

### Step 1: Establish Governance and Mandate

Secure political commitment and organizational mandate for adaptation planning. Assign leadership responsibility and establish a cross-departmental adaptation team. Identify external partners and stakeholders who will participate in the planning process. Allocate budget and resources for the planning process, including climate data acquisition and stakeholder engagement.

### Step 2: Assess Climate Risks and Vulnerabilities

Gather climate data relevant to the locality, including historical climate records, downscaled climate projections, and extreme event analyses. Assess the exposure and sensitivity of key community systems to identified climate hazards. Evaluate adaptive capacity—the existing ability of systems and communities to cope with and adjust to climate impacts. Synthesize findings into a risk profile that identifies the most significant climate risks facing the community.

### Step 3: Prioritize Risks and Identify Adaptation Options

Engage stakeholders to prioritize climate risks based on agreed criteria. For each priority risk, identify and evaluate a range of adaptation options. Consider infrastructure solutions, nature-based solutions, policy instruments, and institutional capacity building. Assess potential maladaptation risks—actions that inadvertently increase vulnerability or shift risk to other populations.

### Step 4: Develop and Adopt the Adaptation Plan

Compile prioritized adaptation actions into a coherent plan with implementation details: responsible departments, timelines, budget estimates, funding sources, and success indicators. Integrate adaptation actions into existing plans and budgets wherever possible. Secure formal adoption of the adaptation plan through appropriate governance processes (council approval, public consultation).

### Step 5: Implement, Monitor, and Review

Execute adaptation actions according to the implementation plan. Establish monitoring systems to track progress against indicators. Conduct periodic reviews to assess whether actions are achieving intended outcomes and whether new risks have emerged. Update the adaptation plan based on monitoring findings, stakeholder feedback, and updated climate projections. Plan for regular revision cycles (typically every 3–5 years).

## Common Pitfalls

**Planning without implementation pathways.** Many local adaptation plans identify risks and recommended actions but lack the governance mechanisms, funding strategies, and institutional capacity to implement them. ISO 14092 emphasizes that planning and implementation must be connected—an adaptation plan without a credible pathway to action is an academic exercise.

**Failing to embed adaptation in mainstream planning.** Standalone adaptation plans that sit outside regular governance processes (land use planning, infrastructure budgets, emergency management) are easily marginalized. Effective adaptation integrates climate considerations into every relevant decision-making process.

**Underestimating the importance of stakeholder engagement.** Local adaptation affects every community member. Plans developed without meaningful engagement—particularly with vulnerable populations and Indigenous communities—miss critical local knowledge, lack public legitimacy, and face implementation resistance.

**Static planning in a dynamic climate.** Climate science evolves, extreme events surprise, and socioeconomic conditions change. Adaptation plans that are not designed for periodic review and update become obsolete. Build adaptive management principles into the planning process from the outset.

## Frequently Asked Questions

### Is ISO 14092 certification possible?

ISO 14092 is a guidance standard, not a requirements standard. Unlike ISO 14001, it is not designed for third-party certification. Organizations cannot be "certified" to ISO 14092. However, they can demonstrate alignment with the standard's framework in their adaptation plans and processes. Some organizations engage third-party reviewers to assess the quality and comprehensiveness of their adaptation plans against ISO 14092 guidance.

### How does ISO 14092 relate to national adaptation plans?

ISO 14092 is designed to complement and operationalize national adaptation strategies at the local level. Many national adaptation plans call for local adaptation action but provide limited guidance on methodology. ISO 14092 fills this gap by providing a structured approach that local governments can follow. The standard is framework-agnostic—it can be used alongside any national adaptation planning requirements or international guidelines (e.g., UNFCCC National Adaptation Plans).

### What climate data do we need for an ISO 14092 assessment?

At minimum, you need historical climate data for your locality (temperature, precipitation, extreme events), downscaled climate projections under multiple emissions scenarios (typically RCP/SSP pathways), and sector-specific impact data (flood risk maps, heat vulnerability indices, sea level rise projections). Data sources include national meteorological agencies, the IPCC, Copernicus Climate Change Service, and local academic institutions. Where high-resolution data is unavailable, regional projections with local expert interpretation can provide a reasonable basis for risk assessment.
