## Overview

The Global Reporting Initiative (GRI) Standards are the world's most widely used sustainability reporting framework. Since GRI published the first global sustainability reporting guidelines in 2000, the framework has evolved through multiple iterations into a comprehensive set of modular standards used by thousands of organizations in over 100 countries.

The current GRI Standards structure, significantly revised in 2021 and effective from January 2023, consists of three tiers: Universal Standards (GRI 1, 2, and 3) that apply to all reporters, Sector Standards that define material topics for specific industries, and Topic Standards that provide detailed disclosure requirements for individual sustainability topics. The 2021 revision strengthened the concept of impact materiality—reporting on the organization's most significant impacts on the economy, environment, and people.

GRI occupies a distinctive position in the disclosure landscape. While the ISSB focuses on investor-relevant financial materiality and the CSRD applies double materiality, GRI centers on impact materiality—the organization's outward effects on the world. This makes GRI the natural framework for organizations that want to communicate with a broad range of stakeholders including employees, communities, civil society, and regulators, not just investors. Notably, EFRAG's ESRS were developed with extensive reference to GRI, and the two frameworks share significant structural alignment.

## Who Does It Apply To?

GRI Standards are voluntary and available to any organization regardless of size, sector, or geography. However, several factors drive adoption:

- **CSRD-subject companies:** ESRS and GRI share substantial alignment. Companies reporting under CSRD will find GRI a useful complementary or preparatory framework.
- **Companies required to report sustainability information** in jurisdictions that reference or mandate GRI (including regulations in India, South Africa, Brazil, and the EU through CSRD/ESRS interoperability).
- **Organizations responding to CDP:** CDP's questionnaire incorporates GRI-aligned metrics.
- **Companies seeking comprehensive stakeholder communication:** GRI's impact materiality focus serves a broader audience than investor-focused frameworks.
- **State-owned enterprises and public sector organizations** often use GRI as their primary reporting framework.
- **Companies in sectors with GRI Sector Standards:** Oil and gas (GRI 11), coal (GRI 12), and agriculture/aquaculture/fishing (GRI 13) have specific sector standards, with more under development.

## Key Requirements

**1. GRI 1: Foundation (Reporting Principles)**
GRI 1 establishes the reporting principles (accuracy, balance, clarity, comparability, completeness, sustainability context, timeliness, verifiability) and the requirements for reporting "in accordance" with GRI. Organizations can report "in accordance" (meeting all requirements) or "with reference to" GRI (using selected standards for specific topics).

**2. GRI 2: General Disclosures**
GRI 2 requires disclosures about the organization itself: activities and workers, governance, strategy, policies, and stakeholder engagement practices. These disclosures provide the context for understanding the organization's sustainability impacts and reporting approach.

**3. GRI 3: Material Topics**
GRI 3 defines the process for determining material topics—the organization's most significant impacts on the economy, environment, and people, including impacts on human rights. The materiality process must involve stakeholder engagement and consider both actual and potential, positive and negative impacts across the value chain.

**4. Topic Standards**
For each material topic identified through the GRI 3 process, the organization reports using the relevant Topic Standard. Topic Standards cover areas including emissions (GRI 305), water (GRI 303), biodiversity (GRI 304), employment (GRI 401), occupational health and safety (GRI 403), human rights (GRI 411), and many others.

**5. Sector Standards**
Where available, Sector Standards identify the topics most likely to be material for organizations in a given sector and specify additional sector-specific disclosures. Organizations in sectors with published Sector Standards must use them as a reference point in their materiality determination process.

**6. Value Chain Reporting**
GRI requires organizations to report on impacts that occur both within their own operations and through their business relationships across the value chain. This includes impacts linked to the organization through its products, services, and commercial relationships, even where the organization does not directly cause the impact.

## Step-by-Step Compliance Roadmap

### Step 1: Determine Reporting Approach

Decide whether to report "in accordance" with GRI or "with reference to" GRI. Reporting in accordance requires meeting all applicable requirements of GRI 1, 2, and 3, plus reporting on all material topics using the relevant Topic Standards. Reporting with reference is less comprehensive but still requires compliance with the specific standards used.

### Step 2: Conduct Materiality Assessment

Follow GRI 3 to determine your material topics. Map your organization's activities and business relationships. Identify actual and potential impacts on the economy, environment, and people. Engage stakeholders to prioritize the most significant impacts. If a Sector Standard applies to your industry, use it as a starting point for identifying likely material topics.

### Step 3: Data Collection and Gap Analysis

For each material topic, review the corresponding Topic Standard disclosures. Assess your current data availability and reporting capabilities against each disclosure requirement. Identify gaps and develop data collection processes to fill them. Assign data ownership to appropriate business functions.

### Step 4: Report Preparation

Compile disclosures across GRI 2 (organizational context), GRI 3 (material topics process), and the relevant Topic Standards. Prepare a GRI Content Index listing where each disclosure can be found. Ensure the report reflects the reporting principles of GRI 1—particularly balance (reporting both positive and negative impacts) and sustainability context (placing performance in the broader context of sustainable development).

### Step 5: Assurance and Stakeholder Feedback

While not mandatory under GRI, external assurance enhances credibility and is increasingly expected by stakeholders. Engage an assurance provider to review all or selected disclosures. Publish the report and actively seek stakeholder feedback. Use feedback to refine your materiality assessment and improve disclosures in subsequent reporting cycles.

## Common Pitfalls

**Cherry-picking material topics.** The GRI 3 process requires systematic identification of significant impacts, not selection of topics where performance is strong. Reports that omit material negative impacts—labor issues, environmental incidents, governance failures—lose credibility with stakeholders who can identify the gaps.

**Reporting data without context.** GRI's sustainability context principle requires organizations to present performance in the broader context of sustainable development. Reporting water consumption figures without reference to local water stress, or emissions data without reference to science-based targets, fails to meet this principle.

**Neglecting the value chain dimension.** GRI requires reporting on impacts that occur through business relationships, not just in direct operations. Companies that report only on their own facilities miss the most significant impacts in sectors where the value chain is the primary impact pathway.

**Confusing GRI materiality with financial materiality.** GRI uses impact materiality—significance of the organization's impacts on people and the environment. This is distinct from financial materiality (relevance to investors) and double materiality (both perspectives). Applying the wrong materiality lens produces a report that serves the wrong audience.

## Frequently Asked Questions

### How does GRI relate to CSRD/ESRS?

GRI and ESRS share substantial structural alignment—EFRAG developed ESRS with GRI as a key reference. The GRI–ESRS interoperability map shows extensive overlap across environmental, social, and governance topics. Companies reporting under both can significantly reduce duplication by maintaining a single data set that serves both frameworks. The key difference is materiality approach: GRI uses impact materiality only, while ESRS applies double materiality (impact + financial). Companies reporting under ESRS will largely satisfy GRI requirements for the overlapping topics, but may need additional GRI-specific disclosures.

### What is the difference between reporting "in accordance" and "with reference to"?

Reporting "in accordance" with GRI means meeting all requirements of GRI 1, completing general disclosures under GRI 2, determining material topics per GRI 3, and reporting on each material topic using the relevant Topic Standards. This is the comprehensive option. Reporting "with reference to" GRI means using selected GRI Standards for specific topics without meeting all framework requirements. It provides flexibility but does not carry the same level of credibility or completeness. The GRI Content Index must clearly indicate which approach is used.

### Do we need external assurance for a GRI report?

GRI does not mandate external assurance, but GRI 1 includes a recommendation that organizations seek external assurance and disclose their assurance policy. In practice, external assurance significantly enhances stakeholder confidence in reported data. Many institutional investors, ratings agencies, and regulatory bodies increasingly expect assurance of sustainability reports. If resources are limited, consider assuring a subset of high-priority disclosures and expanding assurance scope over time.
