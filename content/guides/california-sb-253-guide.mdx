## Overview

California Senate Bill 253, the Climate Corporate Data Accountability Act, signed into law in October 2023, establishes the most expansive mandatory greenhouse gas emissions reporting requirement in the United States. The law requires large companies doing business in California to publicly disclose their Scope 1, Scope 2, and Scope 3 greenhouse gas emissions, making California the first U.S. state to mandate full value chain emissions reporting.

SB 253 applies to both public and private companies—a critical distinction from the SEC climate rules, which apply only to SEC registrants. The revenue threshold of $1 billion captures a broad swath of the corporate landscape, including privately held companies, foreign entities with significant California operations, and companies across every sector of the economy.

The California Air Resources Board (CARB) is the implementing agency, tasked with developing detailed regulations that specify reporting methodologies, timelines, and the digital reporting platform. CARB's implementing regulations, initially expected by January 2025, have been subject to delay and refinement, reflecting the complexity of operationalizing full value chain emissions reporting for thousands of companies. As of early 2026, the regulatory framework is taking shape but companies should closely monitor CARB's final rulemaking.

## Who Does It Apply To?

SB 253 applies to **reporting entities** defined as partnerships, corporations, limited liability companies, or other business entities with total annual revenues exceeding $1 billion that "do business in California" as defined under existing California tax law (Revenue and Taxation Code Section 23101).

Key points on applicability:

- **Revenue threshold:** $1 billion in total annual revenues. This is entity-level revenue, not California-specific revenue.
- **Doing business in California:** Under California tax law, this includes entities that are organized in California, have sales in California, own or use property in California, or have compensation paid in California exceeding specified thresholds. The threshold for "doing business" is notably low.
- **Entity type:** Both public and private entities are covered. There is no exemption for privately held companies, partnerships, or foreign entities.
- **Industry sector:** No sector exemptions. All entities meeting the threshold must report.
- **Estimated scope:** CARB estimates approximately 5,300 entities will be subject to the law, though this figure may evolve as implementing regulations clarify definitional questions.

Companies should assess their California nexus carefully. The "doing business in California" standard is broad and captures many entities that may not have a significant physical presence in the state.

## Key Requirements

**1. Scope 1 and Scope 2 Emissions Reporting**
Reporting entities must annually disclose Scope 1 (direct) and Scope 2 (indirect from purchased energy) GHG emissions. Emissions must be quantified in accordance with the GHG Protocol Corporate Standard or an equivalent methodology approved by CARB.

**2. Scope 3 Emissions Reporting**
Reporting entities must disclose Scope 3 (value chain) emissions. This encompasses all 15 categories defined by the GHG Protocol Corporate Value Chain Standard, including purchased goods and services, transportation, use of sold products, and end-of-life treatment. The law includes a safe harbor provision recognizing the inherent uncertainty in Scope 3 data.

**3. GHG Protocol Methodology**
Emissions must be quantified using the Greenhouse Gas Protocol Corporate Accounting and Reporting Standard and the Corporate Value Chain Standard, or equivalent standards established by CARB. This provides methodological consistency with international practice.

**4. Independent Assurance**
Scope 1 and Scope 2 emissions must be verified by an independent third-party assurance provider. Limited assurance is required initially, with a transition to reasonable assurance in subsequent years. CARB will specify the assurance standards and provider qualifications in its implementing regulations.

**5. Public Disclosure on Digital Platform**
Emissions data must be reported on a publicly accessible digital reporting platform managed by CARB. This means emissions data will be available to investors, customers, competitors, civil society, and the general public—a significant transparency commitment.

**6. Consolidated Reporting**
Emissions must be reported at the entity level that meets the revenue threshold. CARB's regulations will clarify consolidation rules, including how subsidiaries, joint ventures, and other corporate structures are treated.

| Reasonable assurance phase-in | TBD by CARB |

*Timelines reflect the original statutory schedule. CARB has indicated adjustments may occur through the rulemaking process. SB 219 (2024) amended some SB 253 provisions, including extending CARB's rulemaking deadline. Monitor CARB's rulemaking for final dates.

## Step-by-Step Compliance Roadmap

### Step 1: Applicability Determination

Assess whether your entity meets the $1 billion revenue threshold and the "doing business in California" standard. Review California Revenue and Taxation Code Section 23101 and consult with tax counsel. Identify which legal entities within your corporate structure trigger the obligation. Determine whether CARB's implementing regulations affect your entity classification.

### Step 2: GHG Inventory Development

Establish or strengthen your GHG emissions inventory in accordance with the GHG Protocol. Define organizational boundaries (equity share or control approach) and operational boundaries. Compile Scope 1 and Scope 2 emissions data with sufficient granularity for independent verification. Begin cataloging Scope 3 emission sources across all 15 categories, prioritizing categories by materiality and data availability.

### Step 3: Scope 3 Methodology and Data Collection

Develop a Scope 3 measurement methodology that balances accuracy with feasibility. Engage key suppliers to obtain primary emissions data where possible. For categories where primary data is unavailable, establish spend-based or activity-based estimation approaches using recognized emission factors. Document all methodologies, assumptions, and data sources. The safe harbor provision protects good-faith efforts, but robust documentation is essential.

### Step 4: Assurance Preparation

Select an independent assurance provider qualified under CARB's forthcoming standards. Implement internal controls over emissions data collection, calculation, and reporting that mirror financial reporting controls. Conduct a dry run of the assurance process to identify data quality issues before the first mandatory reporting cycle.

### Step 5: Reporting and Continuous Improvement

Prepare and submit emissions data on CARB's digital platform by the applicable deadline. Include all required disclosures and the assurance provider's report. After the first reporting cycle, identify areas for data quality improvement—particularly in Scope 3 categories relying on estimates. Expand primary data collection with suppliers and business partners in subsequent years.

## Common Pitfalls

**Assuming private company exemption.** Unlike the SEC rules, SB 253 applies to private companies. Many privately held companies with $1 billion or more in revenue have never been required to publicly disclose emissions data. The transition from no disclosure to full Scope 1/2/3 public reporting is a significant operational undertaking that requires early preparation.

**Underestimating the "doing business in California" breadth.** The California tax nexus standard is broad. Companies with relatively modest California sales or operations may still qualify. Do not assume you are outside scope without a thorough legal analysis.

**Treating Scope 3 safe harbor as a free pass.** The safe harbor protects companies from liability for good-faith Scope 3 estimates that later prove inaccurate. It does not excuse failure to report Scope 3 or the use of clearly unreasonable methodologies. Companies must demonstrate genuine effort to measure value chain emissions using appropriate data and methods.

**Ignoring overlap with other mandates.** Companies subject to SB 253 may also face requirements under the SEC climate rules, California SB 261, CSRD, or other jurisdictions' mandates. A fragmented approach to emissions reporting across these frameworks wastes resources. Build a single, robust emissions inventory that serves multiple reporting obligations.

## Frequently Asked Questions

### Does SB 253 apply to companies headquartered outside California?

Yes. SB 253 applies to any entity "doing business in California" with annual revenues exceeding $1 billion, regardless of where the entity is headquartered. The "doing business" standard under California tax law is broad and includes entities with sales, property, or employees in California above specified thresholds. Foreign companies with significant California operations or sales channels should assess their applicability carefully.

### What is the Scope 3 safe harbor provision?

SB 253 includes a safe harbor that shields reporting entities from administrative or civil penalties based solely on their Scope 3 emissions disclosures, provided those disclosures are made in good faith using reasonable methodologies. This recognizes the inherent uncertainty in value chain emissions data. However, the safe harbor does not apply to Scope 1 and 2 reporting, and it does not protect against claims based on fraudulent or intentionally misleading disclosures.

### How does SB 253 interact with SB 261?

SB 261, the Climate-Related Financial Risk Act, is a companion law requiring companies with annual revenues over $500 million doing business in California to prepare biennial reports on climate-related financial risks in alignment with TCFD recommendations. SB 253 and SB 261 are distinct laws with different requirements, thresholds, and timelines, but they share a common goal of increasing climate transparency. Companies exceeding $1 billion in revenue will need to comply with both. The data and processes developed for SB 253 emissions reporting directly support the SB 261 risk disclosure requirements.

### What are the penalties for non-compliance?

SB 253 authorizes administrative penalties of up to $500,000 per reporting year for failure to file or for filing with material misstatements. The penalty structure gives CARB enforcement authority, though the specific enforcement procedures will be detailed in the implementing regulations. Companies should note that public availability of the data also creates reputational consequences for non-compliance or clearly inadequate reporting.
