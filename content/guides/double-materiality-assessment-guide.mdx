## Overview

Double materiality is the foundational concept underpinning the EU's Corporate Sustainability Reporting Directive (CSRD) and the European Sustainability Reporting Standards (ESRS). It requires organizations to assess sustainability topics from two distinct but interconnected perspectives: impact materiality (how the organization affects people and the environment) and financial materiality (how sustainability issues create risks and opportunities that affect the organization's financial position and performance).

This dual lens distinguishes the European approach from the single-materiality frameworks used by the ISSB (which focuses on financial materiality) and the traditional GRI approach (which focuses on impact materiality). Under CSRD, a sustainability topic is material if it is significant from either perspective—the two lenses are additive, not alternatives.

The double materiality assessment is not merely a compliance exercise—it is the strategic gateway to your entire CSRD report. The topics you determine to be material define the ESRS disclosures you must produce. An assessment that is too narrow risks missing required disclosures; one that is too broad creates unnecessary reporting burden. Getting it right requires analytical rigor, genuine stakeholder engagement, and cross-functional collaboration between sustainability, risk, strategy, and finance teams.

## Who Does It Apply To?

Double materiality assessment is required for all entities reporting under the CSRD. This includes:

- **Phase 1 (FY 2024):** Large public-interest entities already reporting under the NFRD (>500 employees)
- **Phase 2 (FY 2025):** All other large undertakings meeting at least two of: >250 employees, >€50M turnover, >€25M total assets
- **Phase 3 (FY 2026):** Listed SMEs (with opt-out until FY 2028)
- **Phase 4 (FY 2028):** Non-EU parent companies with >€150M EU turnover

Beyond CSRD-mandated entities, any organization seeking to apply best-practice materiality methodology can benefit from the double materiality approach. It provides the most comprehensive view of which sustainability topics matter—both to the world and to the business.

## Key Requirements

**1. Impact Materiality Assessment**
Assess the organization's actual and potential, positive and negative impacts on people and the environment. Impacts may result from the organization's own operations or be connected to its upstream and downstream value chain. Significance of impacts is evaluated based on scale, scope, irremediable character, and (for potential impacts) likelihood.

**2. Financial Materiality Assessment**
Assess how sustainability issues generate risks and opportunities that are or could be material to the organization's financial position, performance, or cash flows. Financial materiality uses the same concept applied in financial reporting—information is material if its omission or misstatement could reasonably be expected to influence investor decisions.

**3. Stakeholder Engagement**
Engage with affected stakeholders (employees, communities, customers, civil society) and users of sustainability information (investors, lenders, regulators) throughout the process. Stakeholder input is essential for identifying impacts that internal analysis might miss and for validating the relative significance of topics.

**4. Value Chain Consideration**
The assessment must consider the full value chain, not just the organization's direct operations. For many companies, the most significant sustainability impacts and financial risks reside upstream (supply chain) or downstream (product use, end of life). ESRS 1 provides a three-year transition provision allowing estimates where specific value chain data is unavailable.

**5. Time Horizon Analysis**
Assess materiality across short-term, medium-term, and long-term time horizons. A sustainability topic may not be financially material today but could become so over a longer horizon (e.g., physical climate risks, regulatory developments). The dynamic nature of materiality requires forward-looking analysis.

**6. Documentation and Governance**
Document the assessment methodology, data sources, stakeholder engagement process, and decision criteria. The double materiality assessment should be reviewed and approved by appropriate governance bodies. ESRS 2 requires disclosure of the materiality assessment process in the sustainability statement.

**7. Connectivity Between Impact and Financial Perspectives**
The two materiality perspectives are related—an impact on the environment may generate financial risk (e.g., through regulation, litigation, or reputation). The assessment should identify these connections, which strengthen the analytical basis for materiality determinations and inform strategy.

## Step-by-Step Compliance Roadmap

### Step 1: Define Scope and Governance

Establish the scope of the assessment: which entities, operations, and value chain segments are included. Form a cross-functional assessment team spanning sustainability, risk, finance, legal, and relevant business units. Define the governance process—who approves materiality determinations and how they connect to the board's oversight of sustainability. Set the project timeline and milestones.

### Step 2: Map the Universe of Sustainability Topics

Start with the ESRS topic list (E1–E5, S1–S4, G1) and any applicable Sector Standards. Supplement with organization-specific topics based on your industry, geography, and business model. Map your value chain to identify where significant impacts and financial exposures may arise. This creates the long list of topics to assess.

### Step 3: Assess Impact Materiality

For each topic on the long list, evaluate the organization's actual and potential impacts. For actual impacts, assess their scale (how severe), scope (how widespread), and irremediable character (how difficult to remediate). For potential impacts, also assess likelihood. Use a combination of data analysis, expert judgment, and stakeholder input. Score and rank topics.

### Step 4: Assess Financial Materiality

For each topic, evaluate whether associated sustainability risks or opportunities could generate material financial effects. Consider the magnitude of potential financial impact and the likelihood of occurrence. Analyze both current effects and those that may materialize over medium and long-term horizons. Use financial risk frameworks and scenario analysis where appropriate.

### Step 5: Determine Material Topics and Report

Combine the impact and financial materiality assessments to determine which topics are material. A topic is material if it meets the threshold under either lens. For material topics, proceed with the detailed ESRS disclosures. For topics determined not to be material, document the rationale for exclusion—ESRS 2 requires this transparency. Disclose the assessment methodology in your sustainability statement.

## Common Pitfalls

**Conflating the two materiality perspectives.** Impact materiality and financial materiality use different criteria and serve different purposes. Running a single assessment that blends the two produces results that satisfy neither. Conduct each assessment distinctly, then combine results.

**Desktop exercises without genuine stakeholder engagement.** A double materiality assessment that relies solely on internal assumptions and secondary research misses the stakeholder perspective that ESRS requires. Genuine engagement—interviews, surveys, workshops with affected communities, employees, investors—is not optional.

**Static, one-time assessment.** Materiality is dynamic. Regulatory changes, scientific developments, market shifts, and extreme events alter the materiality of topics over time. Build annual reassessment into your governance calendar, even if the CSRD does not explicitly mandate annual review.

**Overly conservative threshold-setting.** Some organizations set materiality thresholds so high that genuinely significant topics are excluded, or so low that the report becomes unwieldy. Calibrate thresholds by benchmarking against peers, testing with stakeholders, and applying professional judgment.

## Frequently Asked Questions

### How does double materiality differ from single materiality?

Single materiality assesses sustainability topics from one perspective only. The ISSB uses financial materiality—what matters to investors. GRI uses impact materiality—how the organization affects people and the planet. Double materiality, as required by CSRD/ESRS, considers both perspectives simultaneously. A topic is material if it is significant from either lens. This means CSRD-subject companies will typically identify more material topics than they would under a single-materiality approach.

### How often should we reassess materiality?

ESRS does not prescribe a specific reassessment frequency, but annual reassessment is emerging as best practice. At minimum, review your materiality assessment annually for changes triggered by new regulatory requirements, significant business changes (acquisitions, new markets), evolving scientific understanding, or major external events. A full reassessment every two to three years, with annual reviews for material changes, is a pragmatic approach.

### Can we use our existing GRI materiality assessment for CSRD?

A GRI materiality assessment covers impact materiality, which is one half of the double materiality equation. You can build on GRI work for the impact dimension, but you must add a financial materiality assessment to satisfy CSRD requirements. Additionally, ESRS has specific methodological guidance (particularly around value chain scope, time horizons, and the scoring criteria for impacts) that may require adjustments to your GRI-based process.

### Who should be involved in the double materiality assessment?

A credible assessment requires cross-functional participation: sustainability (expertise on ESG topics), risk management (risk assessment methodology), finance (financial impact evaluation), strategy (business model implications), legal (regulatory obligations), and relevant business units (operational knowledge). Externally, engage investors, employees, customers, suppliers, affected communities, and subject matter experts. The governance body that approves the assessment should include senior leadership with authority over sustainability reporting.
