## What is a Carbon Tax?

A carbon tax sets a direct price on greenhouse gas emissions, typically expressed as a dollar or euro amount per tonne of CO₂e. Emitters pay the tax on every tonne they release. The economic logic is straightforward: by making pollution costly, the tax incentivizes emitters to reduce emissions whenever abatement costs less than the tax rate, and to pay the tax when abatement is more expensive.

Canada operates one of the most prominent carbon tax systems, with the federal carbon price rising annually—reaching CAD 80/tonne in 2024 and scheduled to hit CAD 170/tonne by 2030. Sweden has taxed carbon since 1991 at rates now exceeding €100/tonne for sectors outside the EU ETS. The UK Carbon Price Support acts as a floor price complement to the EU ETS (and post-Brexit, the UK ETS). Over 30 national and subnational jurisdictions have implemented some form of carbon tax.

Carbon taxes generate government revenue that can be recycled in various ways: returned to citizens as dividends (Canada's Climate Action Incentive), used to fund clean energy investments, or applied to reduce other taxes. The revenue recycling mechanism significantly affects the policy's political viability and economic impact. British Columbia's carbon tax was initially designed as revenue-neutral, with equivalent reductions in income and corporate taxes.

## What is Cap and Trade?

Cap and trade sets a regulatory limit (cap) on total emissions from covered sectors. The government issues allowances equal to the cap and distributes them through free allocation, auctioning, or a combination. Emitters must hold allowances equal to their emissions and can trade surplus allowances with others. The cap declines over time, tightening the market and driving emission reductions.

The EU ETS is the world's largest cap-and-trade system, covering roughly 10,000 installations across power generation, manufacturing, and aviation within Europe. Launched in 2005, it has gone through four phases of reform, with Phase 4 (2021-2030) implementing a steeper cap reduction (4.3% annually from 2024) and the Carbon Border Adjustment Mechanism (CBAM) to prevent carbon leakage. California's cap-and-trade program, linked with Quebec's, covers about 80% of the state's emissions.

Cap-and-trade systems generate revenue through allowance auctions. California has raised over $25 billion from its cap-and-trade auctions since 2013, directing proceeds to clean transportation, housing, natural resources, and community investment. The EU ETS generated over €40 billion in auction revenue in 2023 alone, funding national climate and energy policies across member states.

## Key Differences

**1. Price vs. quantity certainty.** A carbon tax fixes the price of emissions and lets the market determine the quantity reduced. Cap and trade fixes the quantity of emissions allowed and lets the market determine the price. This is the foundational economic distinction. Policymakers who prioritize budget certainty for businesses prefer taxes; those who prioritize meeting specific emission targets prefer caps.

**2. Price volatility.** Carbon tax rates are set by legislation and change on predictable schedules. Cap-and-trade prices fluctuate based on supply and demand—EU ETS prices swung from €5/tonne in 2017 to over €100/tonne in 2023, then back to €65 in 2025. This volatility creates uncertainty for long-term investment planning, though market stability reserves and price floors can moderate it.

**3. Administrative complexity.** Carbon taxes are administratively simpler—they piggyback on existing tax collection infrastructure. Cap-and-trade systems require emissions monitoring, reporting, and verification (MRV) infrastructure, registry systems, auction platforms, and market oversight to prevent manipulation. The EU ETS required over a decade of reforms to function effectively.

**4. Revenue generation.** Both generate government revenue, but through different mechanisms. Carbon taxes produce predictable revenue streams. Cap-and-trade auction revenue depends on allowance prices, which fluctuate. Free allocation of allowances—common in early phases to ease transition—generates no revenue at all.

**5. Political dynamics.** Carbon taxes face the political stigma of being explicitly called a "tax." Cap-and-trade systems obscure the cost from voters since the price is embedded in products rather than appearing on a tax bill. However, both ultimately raise costs for consumers—the political question is transparency versus palatability.

**6. Emission outcome certainty.** Cap and trade guarantees that total emissions won't exceed the cap (assuming robust enforcement). A carbon tax doesn't guarantee a specific emission outcome—if the price is set too low, emissions may not decline enough. Setting the "right" tax rate requires information about abatement costs that regulators may not have.

**7. International linkage.** Cap-and-trade systems can link across jurisdictions—California and Quebec linked their markets in 2014. Carbon taxes are harder to link formally, though harmonized tax rates across countries could achieve similar effects. Article 6 of the Paris Agreement primarily facilitates market-based (cap-and-trade-style) linkages.

## Which One Do You Need?

As a company, you don't choose—governments choose for you. Your strategic question is how to respond to the carbon pricing mechanism in your jurisdiction. If you operate under a cap-and-trade system, your strategy involves emissions monitoring, allowance management, abatement investment decisions, and potentially trading. If you're subject to a carbon tax, your strategy centers on abatement investments that cost less than the tax rate.

For companies operating across jurisdictions, you may face both mechanisms simultaneously. A multinational with operations in the EU (cap and trade) and Canada (carbon tax) must manage both. Internal carbon pricing—setting a shadow price on emissions across all operations—provides a unified framework for investment decisions regardless of the external pricing mechanism.

Companies not yet subject to carbon pricing should anticipate it. The trend is unambiguous: carbon pricing coverage expanded from 5% of global emissions in 2010 to over 23% in 2024. Setting an internal carbon price now prepares capital allocation processes for the inevitable expansion of external pricing.

## Can You Use Both?

Jurisdictions generally choose one mechanism per sector to avoid double-taxing the same emissions. However, some jurisdictions layer both: the UK applies a Carbon Price Support (tax) as a floor beneath the ETS price. Canada applies its federal carbon price backstop in provinces that lack equivalent provincial pricing, which can be either a tax or a cap-and-trade system.

From a corporate perspective, the practical question is managing across jurisdictions with different mechanisms. A consistent internal carbon price, set at or above the highest external price you face, simplifies decision-making. It ensures that abatement investments pencil out regardless of which mechanism applies in a given location.

Some economists advocate for hybrid systems that combine the emission certainty of a cap with the price stability of a tax—using price floors and ceilings within cap-and-trade systems to create a "price corridor." The EU ETS Market Stability Reserve and California's price containment reserves move in this direction without being full hybrids.

## Council Fire's Perspective

Both mechanisms work when designed well. The EU ETS struggled for a decade with overallocation and low prices before reforms made it effective. British Columbia's carbon tax has been credited with reducing emissions while maintaining economic growth. The instrument matters less than the ambition of its design—the level of the price or the tightness of the cap.

For our clients, we focus less on the theoretical debate between taxes and trading and more on practical readiness. Can you measure your emissions accurately? Do you know your marginal abatement costs? Have you identified investments that pay for themselves under current or anticipated carbon prices? These questions apply regardless of which mechanism your jurisdiction adopts.

## Frequently Asked Questions

### Which system reduces emissions more effectively?
Economic theory suggests both can achieve equivalent outcomes if designed correctly. In practice, cap and trade provides more certainty about total emission levels (the cap is fixed), while carbon taxes provide more certainty about costs. Real-world evidence shows both can drive meaningful reductions when prices are sufficiently high.

### Why doesn't the United States have a national carbon price?
Political opposition has blocked federal carbon pricing legislation for decades. The Waxman-Markey cap-and-trade bill passed the House in 2009 but failed in the Senate. The US instead relies on a patchwork of state-level programs (California cap-and-trade, RGGI), sector-specific regulations (EPA power plant rules), and tax incentives (Inflation Reduction Act clean energy credits).

### What is a carbon border adjustment mechanism?
A CBAM imposes carbon costs on imports from countries without equivalent carbon pricing, preventing "carbon leakage"—where companies relocate production to avoid carbon costs. The EU CBAM began its transitional phase in October 2023, covering cement, iron, steel, aluminum, fertilizers, electricity, and hydrogen. Full implementation with financial adjustments starts in 2026.

### How high does a carbon price need to be to drive meaningful change?
The High-Level Commission on Carbon Prices (2017) recommended $50-100/tonne by 2030 to meet Paris Agreement goals. Current estimates suggest $100-150/tonne may be necessary for deep decarbonization across hard-to-abate sectors. EU ETS prices have already reached this range, demonstrating that high carbon prices are achievable in practice.
