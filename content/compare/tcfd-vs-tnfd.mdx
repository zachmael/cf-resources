faqs:
  - question: "Is TNFD replacing TCFD?"
    answer: "No. TNFD complements TCFD — it extends the same disclosure logic from climate to nature. TCFD itself has been effectively absorbed into ISSB's IFRS S2 standard, but its four-pillar structure (governance, strategy, risk management, metrics/targets) lives on in both ISSB and TNFD. Companies should think of TNFD as the nature equivalent, not a replacement."
  - question: "Do I need to report under both?"
    answer: "If your business has material exposure to both climate and nature-related risks (most do), yes. Climate and nature are deeply interconnected — deforestation drives climate change; climate change drives biodiversity loss. Reporting on one without the other gives an incomplete risk picture. CSRD already requires both climate and biodiversity-related disclosure."
  - question: "How mature is TNFD compared to TCFD?"
    answer: "TCFD was published in 2017 and has had years of adoption and refinement. TNFD published its final recommendations in September 2023. TNFD is newer, with fewer reporting examples, less developed data ecosystems, and evolving guidance. Early adoption is growing — over 400 organizations endorsed TNFD in its first year — but the maturity gap is real."
  - question: "What data do I need for TNFD that I don't already have for TCFD?"
    answer: "TNFD requires location-specific nature dependency and impact data — which ecosystems your operations and supply chains interact with, what services those ecosystems provide, and how your activities affect them. This includes biodiversity metrics, land use data, water dependency mapping, and supply chain traceability to source locations. Most companies lack this data initially."

## Quick Comparison

- **Focus area**: TCFD addresses climate-related financial risks and opportunities. TNFD addresses nature-related risks and opportunities, covering biodiversity, ecosystems, and natural capital.
- **Structure**: Both use the same four-pillar framework — Governance, Strategy, Risk Management, and Metrics & Targets. TNFD deliberately mirrors TCFD to reduce the learning curve for companies already reporting on climate.
- **Publisher**: TCFD was created by the Financial Stability Board in 2015 and published recommendations in 2017. TNFD was launched in 2021 by a coalition including UNDP, UNEP FI, WWF, and Global Canopy, publishing final recommendations in September 2023.
- **Current status**: TCFD completed its mandate in 2023 and its monitoring responsibilities transferred to the ISSB. TNFD is actively expanding, developing sector guidance, and building adoption.
- **Data maturity**: Climate data (emissions, energy, carbon pricing) is relatively standardized with established measurement protocols. Nature data (biodiversity metrics, ecosystem dependencies, land use impact) is less standardized with emerging measurement tools.

## What is TCFD?

The Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures was established by the Financial Stability Board in 2015 and published its recommendations in 2017. TCFD created the framework for climate risk disclosure that has become the global standard structure — organized around four pillars: governance, strategy, risk management, and metrics/targets.

TCFD's core contribution was framing climate change as a financial risk rather than purely an environmental concern. By asking companies to disclose how climate risks and opportunities affect their financial position, TCFD made climate relevant to CFOs, boards, and investors — not just sustainability teams.

Key TCFD requirements include disclosure of board and management oversight of climate risks, the actual and potential impacts of climate risks on business strategy, how the organization identifies and manages climate risks, and the metrics used to assess climate-related performance. Scenario analysis — stress-testing business models under different warming pathways — became TCFD's signature requirement.

TCFD achieved remarkable adoption. Over 4,900 organizations across 100+ countries endorsed the framework. Multiple jurisdictions made TCFD-aligned disclosure mandatory or referenced it in regulation — the UK, Japan, New Zealand, Singapore, Hong Kong, and others. When the ISSB published IFRS S2, it built directly on TCFD's structure, effectively codifying TCFD recommendations into a formal global standard.

The TCFD disbanded in October 2023, having achieved its mission. The FSB transferred monitoring responsibilities to the ISSB. But the TCFD framework — its four pillars, its scenario analysis approach, its risk categorization (physical and transition) — remains the foundation of climate disclosure globally.

## What is TNFD?

The Taskforce on Nature-related Financial Disclosures published its final recommendations in September 2023, applying TCFD's proven disclosure architecture to nature and biodiversity. Where TCFD asked "how does climate affect your business and how does your business affect climate?", TNFD asks the same questions about nature.

TNFD defines nature through four realms: land, ocean, freshwater, and atmosphere. It considers both the dependencies businesses have on nature (clean water, pollination, soil fertility, climate regulation) and the impacts businesses have on nature (habitat destruction, pollution, resource extraction, invasive species introduction).

The TNFD framework introduces the LEAP approach — Locate, Evaluate, Assess, Prepare — as a practical methodology for identifying and assessing nature-related risks. Companies start by locating their interface with nature (where do operations and supply chains interact with ecosystems?), evaluate dependencies and impacts, assess material risks and opportunities, and prepare disclosures.

This location-specific approach is a key distinction from TCFD. Climate risk can be assessed at a corporate level using aggregate emissions data. Nature risk requires understanding specific ecosystems — a palm oil supplier's impact depends on whether the plantation is in intact rainforest or degraded agricultural land. A manufacturer's water dependency varies dramatically by watershed.

TNFD adoption is growing rapidly. Over 400 organizations endorsed the framework in its first year. Japan became the first country to recommend TNFD-aligned disclosure. The EU's CSRD requires nature and biodiversity disclosure under ESRS E4. CBD's Global Biodiversity Framework (adopted at COP15) set targets that align with TNFD's disclosure architecture.

## Key Differences

- **Subject matter**: TCFD covers climate change — greenhouse gas emissions, physical climate hazards, energy transition, carbon pricing. TNFD covers the broader natural world — biodiversity loss, ecosystem degradation, land use change, water stress, ocean health, deforestation, pollution.
- **Measurement maturity**: Carbon emissions have a standardized measurement protocol (GHG Protocol), established units (tonnes CO₂e), and decades of reporting experience. Nature metrics are less standardized — there's no single "biodiversity equivalent" of tonnes of CO₂. TNFD recommends multiple metrics including species abundance, ecosystem extent, and ecosystem condition.
- **Location dependency**: TCFD metrics can be aggregated at corporate level — total Scope 1 emissions are the same regardless of where they're emitted. TNFD metrics are inherently location-specific — the impact of water withdrawal depends entirely on the watershed. This makes TNFD data collection more complex and supply chain traceability more critical.
- **Interconnection with climate**: Climate change is one of five drivers of nature loss (alongside land/sea use change, resource exploitation, pollution, and invasive species). TNFD explicitly recognizes this connection. Nature-based solutions (forests, wetlands, mangroves) also serve as climate mitigation and adaptation. The two frameworks are complementary, not parallel.
- **Sector relevance**: TCFD applies broadly — virtually every company has climate risk exposure. TNFD's urgency varies more by sector. Agriculture, food/beverage, forestry, mining, pharmaceuticals, construction, and financial services (through portfolio exposure) face the most immediate nature-related risks.
- **Regulatory momentum**: TCFD has been mandated or referenced by regulators in major economies since 2020. TNFD regulatory adoption is earlier-stage — CSRD covers biodiversity, and COP15 targets create policy pressure, but standalone TNFD mandates are still emerging.

## When to Use Each

**Focus on TCFD/ISSB S2 when:**
- You need to meet mandatory climate disclosure requirements in your jurisdiction
- Your primary risks are climate-related (carbon-intensive operations, fossil fuel exposure, physical climate hazards)
- You're building your first structured sustainability disclosure program
- Investors are requesting climate-specific risk data and scenario analysis

**Adopt TNFD when:**
- Your business directly depends on natural resources (agriculture, forestry, fisheries, water-intensive manufacturing)
- You operate in or source from biodiversity-sensitive regions
- You're subject to CSRD and need to address ESRS E4 (biodiversity and ecosystems)
- Your sector is identified by TNFD as high nature-dependency or high nature-impact
- You want to stay ahead of emerging nature-related regulation and investor expectations

**Report under both when:**
- You want a complete picture of environmental risk and impact
- CSRD applies (requiring both climate and nature disclosure)
- Your business model depends on both stable climate conditions AND healthy ecosystems
- You're a financial institution assessing portfolio-level environmental risk across both dimensions

## Council Fire's Recommendation

If you've already built TCFD-aligned disclosure, you have the structural foundation for TNFD — the four pillars are identical. The work is in extending your risk assessment from climate to nature, building location-specific data on ecosystem dependencies and impacts, and developing nature-related metrics alongside your climate metrics.

Don't wait for TNFD mandates to start. Nature-related risks are already materializing — water scarcity affecting semiconductor manufacturing, pollinator decline threatening agricultural supply chains, deforestation regulations blocking market access. Companies that map their nature dependencies now will manage these risks better than those scrambling to comply later.

Council Fire helps companies extend their climate disclosure programs to cover nature-related risks, building the LEAP assessment methodology, location-specific data infrastructure, and integrated reporting that satisfies both TCFD/ISSB and TNFD requirements.
