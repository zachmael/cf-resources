faqs:
  - question: "Do I need to report under both CDP and GRI?"
    answer: "Many large companies do. CDP questionnaires are increasingly expected by investors (through CDP's investor signatory network) and customers (through the CDP Supply Chain program). GRI provides the framework for your broader sustainability report. The data overlaps — particularly for emissions, energy, water, and forests — so building a unified data system that feeds both is efficient."
  - question: "Does a good CDP score replace the need for a GRI report?"
    answer: "No. CDP scores cover environmental topics (climate, water, forests) through a standardized questionnaire format. GRI covers the full range of sustainability topics including social issues (labor, human rights, community impact) and governance. CDP tells investors how you manage environmental risk; GRI tells all stakeholders about your full sustainability performance and impact."
  - question: "Which is more important for investors?"
    answer: "CDP has stronger direct investor engagement. Over 740 institutional investors with $136 trillion in assets use CDP data. GRI is more widely used overall but its audience is broader. If investor pressure is your primary driver, CDP response is harder to avoid. But investor-focused sustainability assessments like DJSI and MSCI also draw on GRI-reported data."
  - question: "Is CDP aligned with other frameworks?"
    answer: "Yes, heavily. CDP aligned its climate questionnaire with TCFD recommendations and is incorporating ISSB requirements. CDP also aligns with GHG Protocol for emissions methodology and references GRI and SASB metrics. Responding to CDP increasingly satisfies multiple framework requirements simultaneously."

## Quick Comparison

- **Format**: CDP is a structured questionnaire system — companies respond to specific questions across climate change, water security, and forests modules. GRI is a reporting framework — companies use GRI standards to prepare sustainability reports or disclosures in their chosen format.
- **Scoring**: CDP scores companies A through D- based on questionnaire responses, producing a public letter grade. GRI doesn't score companies — it provides disclosure standards and companies self-declare their reporting level.
- **Topic coverage**: CDP covers three environmental themes: climate change, water security, and forests/deforestation. GRI covers the full sustainability spectrum — environmental, social, economic, and governance topics.
- **Who requests it**: CDP questionnaires are sent to companies on behalf of institutional investors (740+ signatories) and purchasing organizations (350+ supply chain members). GRI reporting is driven by regulatory requirements, stakeholder expectations, and voluntary commitment.
- **Data access**: CDP scores and response data are publicly available. GRI reports are published by the reporting organization and registered in GRI's database.

## What is CDP?

CDP (formerly the Carbon Disclosure Project) runs the world's largest environmental disclosure platform. Founded in 2000, CDP sends annual questionnaires to thousands of companies on behalf of investors and purchasing organizations, collecting data on climate change, water security, and forests/deforestation.

The climate change questionnaire is CDP's flagship product. It asks detailed questions about governance, risk management, strategy, emissions data (Scope 1, 2, and 3), targets, and climate-related financial impacts. Companies are scored on a scale from A (leadership) to D- (disclosure), with F indicating failure to respond. Only about 2% of responding companies achieve an A rating in any given year.

CDP's power comes from its demand side. When 740+ institutional investors with $136 trillion in assets ask you to respond, "voluntary" becomes functionally mandatory for large public companies. The CDP Supply Chain program extends this pressure — major purchasers like Walmart, Microsoft, and L'Oréal request CDP responses from their suppliers, cascading disclosure requirements down value chains.

CDP has strategically aligned with major frameworks. Its climate questionnaire incorporates TCFD's four-pillar structure and is integrating ISSB requirements. CDP serves as the reporting platform for SBTi-validated targets. This alignment means a thorough CDP response increasingly satisfies multiple disclosure expectations simultaneously.

The water security and forests questionnaires follow similar structures but cover resource-specific risks, dependencies, and management approaches. Water security is gaining prominence as water stress intensifies globally, and the forests questionnaire addresses deforestation risk in commodity supply chains (palm oil, soy, cattle, timber, cocoa, rubber, coffee).

## What is GRI?

GRI (Global Reporting Initiative) provides the most widely used sustainability reporting standards globally. Over 10,000 organizations in 100+ countries use GRI standards to report on their economic, environmental, social, and governance impacts.

GRI's structure consists of Universal Standards (applicable to all organizations), Topic Standards (covering specific subjects like emissions, water, labor practices, human rights, anti-corruption), and Sector Standards (providing guidance for specific industries). Organizations conduct materiality assessments to identify their most significant impacts, then report against the relevant topic standards.

Unlike CDP's questionnaire format, GRI provides a framework that organizations use to build their own sustainability reports. This creates more variation in reporting format and depth — some companies publish 200-page GRI reports, others integrate GRI disclosures into annual reports, and some provide GRI content indexes referencing disclosures across multiple documents.

GRI's materiality is impact-based. Organizations report on topics where they have the most significant positive or negative impacts on the economy, environment, and people. This is different from financial materiality (what affects the company's financial value) and creates disclosures that serve communities, employees, regulators, and civil society alongside investors.

GRI's regulatory relevance strengthened significantly when the EU built CSRD's European Sustainability Reporting Standards (ESRS) on GRI foundations. Companies already reporting under GRI have a substantial head start on CSRD compliance, though ESRS adds financial materiality requirements and specific data points that go beyond GRI.

## Key Differences

- **Active vs. passive**: CDP actively solicits disclosure by sending questionnaires on behalf of investors and customers. GRI passively provides standards — companies decide to report. This gives CDP leverage: non-response is visible and carries reputational cost.
- **Scoring vs. self-declaration**: CDP produces a public score that enables direct comparison and ranking. GRI reporting is self-declared with no scoring mechanism — comparability depends on the reporting organization's choices. CDP's scoring creates competitive pressure that drives improvement.
- **Environmental focus vs. full ESG**: CDP covers climate, water, and forests. GRI covers everything — including labor practices, human rights, community impact, anti-corruption, economic performance, and governance. If your material issues include social topics, GRI is essential; CDP alone won't cover them.
- **Standardized vs. flexible**: CDP's questionnaire is identical for all respondents within each module (with some sector-specific questions). GRI allows organizations to select topics and shape their reporting. CDP's standardization aids comparability; GRI's flexibility aids relevance.
- **Platform vs. framework**: CDP is both a standard and a platform — companies submit responses through CDP's online system, and CDP hosts, scores, and distributes the data. GRI provides standards only — companies publish reports themselves and register them in GRI's database.
- **Supply chain reach**: CDP's Supply Chain program extends environmental disclosure requirements to suppliers of member companies. GRI doesn't have an equivalent mechanism for cascading reporting requirements through supply chains.

## When to Use Each

**Respond to CDP when:**
- Institutional investors have requested your CDP response (check CDP's annual questionnaire list)
- Major customers participate in CDP Supply Chain and request supplier disclosure
- You want a scored, comparable environmental disclosure that investors actively use
- You need to demonstrate TCFD-aligned climate disclosure through a structured format
- Your peers in the industry respond to CDP and non-response would stand out

**Report under GRI when:**
- You need to cover sustainability topics beyond environmental — social, governance, economic
- CSRD applies or will apply to your organization (ESRS builds on GRI)
- You want a mature, globally recognized sustainability reporting framework
- Your stakeholders include communities, employees, and regulators alongside investors
- You want to conduct a materiality assessment covering all significant impacts

**Use both when:**
- You're a large company with diverse stakeholder reporting expectations
- Investors request CDP AND you need a full sustainability report under GRI
- You want environmental depth (CDP) alongside broad sustainability coverage (GRI)
- You're building toward CSRD compliance while maintaining investor-facing disclosure

## Council Fire's Recommendation

Most large companies will end up responding to CDP AND reporting under GRI — they serve different functions and different audiences. The good news: the underlying data overlaps significantly. Emissions, energy, water, governance, risk management — these appear in both CDP questionnaires and GRI reports.

Build your data collection once to serve both outputs. Capture GHG emissions data at the granularity CDP requires. Document governance and risk management processes in ways that satisfy both CDP's structured questions and GRI's disclosure standards. Maintain a master dataset that feeds CDP responses, GRI reports, CSRD/ESRS filings, and investor presentations.

If you can only start with one, start with CDP's climate change questionnaire — the investor pressure is direct and the scoring creates accountability. Then extend to GRI when you're ready to cover social topics, conduct a full materiality assessment, and build toward CSRD readiness.

Council Fire helps companies build integrated disclosure programs that serve CDP, GRI, ISSB, and CSRD requirements from a single data infrastructure — eliminating redundant work, improving data quality, and ensuring consistency across all reporting channels.
