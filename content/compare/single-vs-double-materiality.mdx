faqs:
  - question: "Does double materiality mean everything is material?"
    answer: "No. Double materiality expands the lens, not the conclusion. Many topics will still be immaterial from both perspectives. The assessment process identifies which topics pass either threshold — financial materiality or impact materiality — and only those require disclosure. A well-run double materiality assessment typically identifies 8-15 material topics, not all of them."
  - question: "Is double materiality harder to implement?"
    answer: "Yes, meaningfully so. Single materiality assessment leverages existing financial risk frameworks. Impact materiality requires assessing your company's effects on people and environment across the value chain — often involving stakeholder engagement, impact pathway analysis, and qualitative judgments that financial teams aren't trained for. Budget 2-4 months for a rigorous double materiality assessment."
  - question: "Which frameworks use which approach?"
    answer: "Single materiality: ISSB/IFRS S1-S2, SEC climate rule, SASB (now part of ISSB). Double materiality: CSRD/ESRS, GRI Standards. CDP is converging toward compatibility with both. The two approaches are not mutually exclusive — double materiality includes financial materiality as one of its two dimensions."
  - question: "Can a topic be financially material but not impact-material, or vice versa?"
    answer: "Absolutely. A water-stressed region affecting your supply chain is financially material even if your water usage there is negligible (impact-immaterial). Conversely, your factory's noise pollution affecting a neighboring community is impact-material even if it poses no financial risk to your company. Double materiality captures both; single materiality captures only the first."

## Quick Comparison

- **Single materiality**: Assesses whether ESG topics affect the company's financial performance, cash flows, or enterprise value. The question: "Does this issue matter to investors?" Used by ISSB, SEC, and traditional financial reporting.
- **Double materiality**: Assesses both financial materiality AND impact materiality — whether the company's activities affect people and the environment, regardless of financial consequences. The question: "Does this issue matter to investors OR to affected stakeholders?" Required by CSRD/ESRS and aligned with GRI.
- **Information users**: Single materiality serves investors and capital markets. Double materiality serves investors, regulators, civil society, employees, communities, and other stakeholders.
- **Regulatory direction**: The EU has committed to double materiality through CSRD. The ISSB uses single materiality but designed IFRS S1-S2 for interoperability with double materiality frameworks. Most jurisdictions outside the EU still default to single materiality.

## What is Single Materiality?

Single materiality — sometimes called financial materiality or enterprise value materiality — evaluates sustainability topics based on whether they create risks or opportunities that affect a company's financial condition. This is the traditional lens of securities regulation and investor-focused disclosure.

Under single materiality, a sustainability topic is material if it could reasonably influence the decisions of investors or lenders. Climate change is material because physical risks (flooding, heat stress) and transition risks (carbon pricing, stranded assets) affect cash flows. Labor practices are material because strikes, turnover, and regulatory fines affect profitability. Governance failures are material because they destroy shareholder value.

The ISSB's IFRS S1 and S2 standards explicitly use this approach. So does the SEC's climate disclosure rule. SASB's industry-specific standards, now maintained by the ISSB, were built entirely on financial materiality — identifying which ESG factors affect enterprise value in each of 77 industries.

The strength of single materiality is clarity and familiarity. CFOs, auditors, and investors understand financial materiality because it mirrors how they've assessed accounting materiality for decades. The framework is well-established, legally tested, and integrates naturally with financial reporting.

## What is Double Materiality?

Double materiality adds a second dimension: impact materiality. A topic is impact-material if the company's activities cause or contribute to significant positive or negative impacts on people or the environment. This applies regardless of whether those impacts create financial risk for the company.

The concept originated in the EU's Non-Financial Reporting Directive and was formalized in CSRD and the European Sustainability Reporting Standards (ESRS). Under ESRS, companies must assess every sustainability topic through both lenses. If a topic passes either threshold — financial materiality or impact materiality — it's material and must be disclosed.

Impact materiality assessment involves mapping your value chain, identifying actual and potential impacts on affected stakeholders and the environment, evaluating impact severity (scale, scope, irremediability) and likelihood, and engaging with affected stakeholders to validate your assessment. This goes well beyond financial risk analysis.

GRI Standards also use an impact-based materiality concept, though the terminology differs slightly. GRI's approach focuses on the organization's most significant impacts on the economy, environment, and people — which aligns closely with CSRD's impact materiality dimension.

## Key Differences

**What gets captured.** Single materiality misses topics that affect the world but don't (yet) affect the company financially. A company dumping waste in a river in a jurisdiction with no enforcement faces no financial risk — single materiality might exclude it. Double materiality captures it because the environmental and community impact is significant regardless of financial consequence.

**Direction of causality.** Single materiality looks inward: how does the world affect our business? Double materiality looks both ways: how does the world affect our business, AND how does our business affect the world? This bidirectional perspective is why proponents call it more complete and critics call it more complex.

**Dynamic versus static.** Double materiality proponents argue that today's impact-only topics become tomorrow's financial risks as regulation tightens, consumer preferences shift, and litigation expands. Companies that only track financially material topics today may be blindsided when an impact they ignored becomes a financial liability. Double materiality functions as an early warning system.

**Stakeholder scope.** Single materiality serves investors. Double materiality serves a broader set of stakeholders — employees, communities, civil society, regulators — who care about corporate impacts regardless of financial consequences. This reflects different beliefs about the purpose of corporate disclosure.

**Implementation complexity.** Single materiality assessment can leverage existing enterprise risk management processes. Double materiality requires additional capabilities: stakeholder engagement, impact pathway analysis, human rights due diligence, environmental impact assessment. Many companies find they need external support for their first double materiality assessment.

## When to Use Each

**Use single materiality if**: your primary audience is investors and capital markets, you're reporting under ISSB or SEC requirements, and you're not subject to CSRD. Single materiality is sufficient for these regulatory contexts and produces decision-useful information for financial stakeholders.

**Use double materiality if**: you're subject to CSRD, you report under GRI Standards, or you want a comprehensive view of your sustainability risks and impacts. Also consider double materiality if your industry faces significant stakeholder pressure on social or environmental impacts that may not yet appear in financial risk assessments.

**Use both lenses proactively if**: you're a multinational facing both ISSB-aligned national requirements and CSRD. The ISSB and EFRAG (which developed ESRS) have published interoperability guidance showing how double materiality assessments can produce outputs satisfying both frameworks.

## Council Fire's Perspective

We recommend double materiality for most clients, even those not yet legally required to adopt it. The reason is practical, not philosophical: topics that are impact-material today frequently become financially material within 3-5 years as regulations tighten, supply chain due diligence laws expand, and litigation increases. Double materiality forces you to see these risks earlier.

That said, we're pragmatic about implementation. Your first double materiality assessment doesn't need to be perfect. Start with your existing financial materiality process, layer in impact assessment for your most significant value chain activities, engage key stakeholder groups, and iterate. The companies that struggle are the ones trying to build a comprehensive double materiality process from scratch in one quarter — it's a capability you build over 2-3 reporting cycles.
