## Quick Comparison

| | Renewable Energy Certificates (RECs) | Carbon Offsets |
|---|---|---|
| **Scope** | Represent 1 MWh of renewable electricity generation attributes | Represent 1 tonne CO₂e reduced or removed |
| **Applicability** | Scope 2 electricity emissions (market-based method) | Any scope; typically used for residual Scope 1, 2, or 3 |
| **Required/Voluntary** | Voluntary for green claims; mandatory in some RPS compliance | Voluntary; limited compliance use in some cap-and-trade systems |
| **Geography** | Market-specific (US RECs, EU Guarantees of Origin, I-RECs) | Global project-based |
| **Key Focus** | Claiming renewable electricity consumption | Compensating for emissions through external reductions |

## What are RECs?

A Renewable Energy Certificate represents the environmental attributes of one megawatt-hour of electricity generated from a renewable source—wind, solar, hydropower, biomass, or geothermal. When a renewable generator produces electricity, two products are created: the physical electricity (delivered to the grid) and the REC (a tradeable certificate representing the "green" attribute). These can be sold together (bundled) or separately (unbundled).

In the United States, RECs are tracked through regional registries such as the Midwest Renewable Energy Tracking System (M-RETS), the Western Renewable Energy Generation Information System (WREGIS), and PJM's Generation Attribute Tracking System (GATS). In Europe, the equivalent instrument is a Guarantee of Origin (GO), tracked by the Association of Issuing Bodies (AIB). The International REC Standard (I-REC) covers markets in Asia, Latin America, Africa, and the Middle East.

RECs serve two primary markets. In compliance markets, utilities purchase RECs to meet Renewable Portfolio Standard (RPS) obligations in states like California, New York, and Massachusetts. In voluntary markets, corporations purchase RECs to make market-based Scope 2 renewable energy claims under the GHG Protocol. RE100 member companies—over 400 large corporations committed to 100% renewable electricity—rely heavily on RECs to substantiate their claims.

## What are Carbon Offsets?

Carbon offsets represent a verified reduction or removal of one metric tonne of CO₂e from the atmosphere, generated by a project outside the buyer's value chain. Projects include forest protection (REDD+), renewable energy installations in developing countries, methane capture at landfills, clean cookstove distribution, and emerging carbon removal technologies like direct air capture and biochar.

Offsets are issued by independent standards bodies—Verra (VCS), Gold Standard, American Carbon Registry (ACR), and Climate Action Reserve (CAR)—each with defined methodologies, verification requirements, and registries. When a buyer retires an offset, the corresponding emission reduction is claimed against their carbon footprint.

The offset market has faced substantial scrutiny around quality, additionality, and permanence. The ICVCM's Core Carbon Principles and VCMI's Claims Code are reshaping market standards. Buyers are shifting toward higher-quality credits—particularly carbon removal credits—as awareness grows that the cheapest available offsets often deliver the least environmental benefit.

## Key Differences

**1. What they represent.** RECs represent clean electricity generation (MWh). Offsets represent emission reductions (tonnes CO₂e). They are fundamentally different units measuring different things.

**2. Where they apply in GHG accounting.** RECs affect Scope 2 emissions under the market-based method—they change the emission factor applied to your electricity consumption. Offsets don't change your emission inventory at all; they provide compensation claimed outside the inventory boundary.

**3. Additionality expectations.** Offsets must demonstrate additionality—the project would not have happened without carbon finance. RECs from existing, grid-connected renewable generators have no additionality requirement; the wind farm would operate regardless of whether you buy its RECs. This difference is significant for environmental integrity.

**4. Accounting treatment.** Buying RECs reduces your reported Scope 2 market-based emissions. Buying offsets does not reduce any reported emissions—it creates a separate claim of compensation. Under GHG Protocol standards, offsets must be reported separately from the emission inventory, not subtracted from reported totals.

**5. Price range.** Unbundled US RECs trade as low as $1-5/MWh. Carbon offsets range from $1/tonne for older renewable energy credits to $100+/tonne for high-quality removals. Bundled RECs from new PPAs carry an implicit cost embedded in the electricity price premium.

**6. Overlap and confusion.** Some carbon offset projects are renewable energy projects—a wind farm in India generating carbon credits under the Clean Development Mechanism. When this happens, the same project may produce both RECs (for the electricity attributes) and offsets (for the emission reductions). Double counting between instruments must be carefully avoided.

**7. Evolving credibility.** Unbundled RECs from existing generators are increasingly viewed as low-impact instruments—they don't drive new renewable capacity. Similarly, cheap avoidance offsets face quality concerns. Both markets are moving toward higher-quality instruments: RECs from new-build projects with temporal and geographic matching, and offsets meeting ICVCM Core Carbon Principles.

## Which One Do You Need?

If your goal is reducing Scope 2 emissions under market-based accounting, you need RECs (or their regional equivalents). They're the only instrument that changes your reported Scope 2 figure. No amount of carbon offsets will reduce your Scope 2 number.

If your goal is compensating for emissions across any scope—particularly residual emissions after reduction efforts—offsets serve that purpose. They're relevant for carbon neutrality claims, SBTi beyond-value-chain mitigation, and VCMI-aligned climate contributions.

Many companies need both. RECs address Scope 2 electricity emissions. Offsets address remaining emissions from Scope 1 (direct emissions from fuel combustion, process emissions) and Scope 3 (value chain emissions) that RECs can't touch. A complete climate strategy integrates both instruments alongside direct emission reductions.

Quality matters more than quantity for both instruments. Cheap unbundled RECs from a 20-year-old wind farm and cheap avoidance offsets from a questionable REDD+ project both undermine credibility. Invest in instruments that drive real-world impact: new-build PPAs for electricity, high-quality removal credits for residuals.

## Can You Use Both?

Yes, and most companies with comprehensive climate strategies do. The key is understanding which instrument serves which purpose and avoiding double counting.

A typical approach: purchase RECs or sign PPAs to cover 100% of electricity consumption (addressing Scope 2 market-based), invest in energy efficiency and operational changes (reducing Scope 1), and purchase high-quality offsets for residual emissions that can't be eliminated through direct action.

The accounting must be clean. If a renewable energy project generates both RECs and carbon credits, the buyer of the RECs claims the electricity attributes and the buyer of the carbon credits claims the emission reduction. The same MWh cannot be claimed twice—once as a REC reducing Scope 2 and again as an offset compensating for other emissions.

## Council Fire's Perspective

We see companies confuse RECs and offsets constantly, and the confusion leads to poor purchasing decisions and vulnerable claims. RECs are for your electricity; offsets are for everything else. Neither is a substitute for operational emission reductions, and the quality of both matters far more than the quantity.

Our guidance is blunt: buy the best instruments you can afford, not the most instruments you can afford. A portfolio of high-impact PPAs with new-build renewables and vetted removal credits demonstrates more genuine commitment than a mountain of $2 unbundled RECs and $3 avoidance offsets—even if the latter covers more tonnes on paper.

## Frequently Asked Questions

### Can RECs offset my Scope 1 emissions?
No. RECs only apply to Scope 2 electricity emissions under market-based accounting. Scope 1 emissions (from combustion, process, fugitive sources) cannot be addressed with RECs. For Scope 1, you need direct operational reductions or carbon offsets for compensation.

### Are renewable energy carbon offsets the same as RECs?
No, though the confusion is understandable. A renewable energy project can generate RECs (representing the electricity attributes) and separately generate carbon offsets (representing the emission reductions versus a fossil fuel baseline). These are distinct instruments tracked on different registries. Buying one does not give you the other.

### Do RECs actually reduce emissions?
Unbundled RECs from existing generators have minimal impact on actual emissions—the generator would operate regardless. However, RECs from new-build projects (particularly through PPAs) signal demand that supports new renewable capacity investment. The impact depends on whether the instrument drives additional clean energy deployment.

### What is the GHG Protocol's position on reporting offsets?
The GHG Protocol Corporate Standard requires companies to report total emissions without subtracting offsets. Offsets must be reported separately, outside the inventory. This prevents companies from using offsets to mask their actual emission levels and ensures transparency about reduction versus compensation.
