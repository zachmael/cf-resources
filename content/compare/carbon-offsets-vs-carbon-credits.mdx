faqs:
  - question: "Are carbon offsets and carbon credits the same thing?"
    answer: "Not exactly. Both represent one tonne of CO₂ equivalent, but they operate in different markets with different rules. Carbon credits typically refer to allowances in compliance markets (like the EU ETS) — permits to emit that are allocated or auctioned by regulators. Carbon offsets are generated by voluntary emission reduction or removal projects and purchased to compensate for emissions elsewhere. The terms overlap in common usage, but the market mechanisms differ."
  - question: "Which is more credible?"
    answer: "Compliance carbon credits carry regulatory backing, standardized verification, and legal enforceability. Their environmental integrity is built into the market design — caps decrease over time, forcing real emission reductions. Voluntary carbon offsets vary enormously in quality. High-quality offsets verified under rigorous standards (Gold Standard, Verra VCS with additional certifications) can be credible, but the market includes many low-quality projects with questionable additionality and permanence."
  - question: "Can I use offsets to meet compliance obligations?"
    answer: "Generally no, though some compliance markets allow limited offset use. The EU ETS does not accept voluntary offsets. California's cap-and-trade system allows limited use of approved offsets (up to 4-6% of obligations). CORSIA (aviation) accepts specific offset programs. Each compliance market has its own rules about offset eligibility."
  - question: "Should my company buy carbon offsets?"
    answer: "Only after you've invested in actual emission reductions. Offsets should cover residual emissions that you cannot yet eliminate — not substitute for decarbonization investment. Prioritize high-quality removal credits over avoidance credits, demand third-party verification, and ensure projects demonstrate additionality, permanence, and no leakage. Never use offsets to claim carbon neutrality without a credible reduction plan."

## Quick Comparison

- **Market type**: Carbon credits primarily operate in compliance markets regulated by governments. Carbon offsets primarily operate in voluntary markets driven by corporate commitments.
- **What they represent**: Both represent one metric tonne of CO₂ equivalent. A compliance credit is a permit to emit; an offset is a claim that one tonne was reduced or removed elsewhere.
- **Who issues them**: Compliance credits are issued by regulatory bodies (EU Commission, California Air Resources Board, etc.). Offsets are issued by voluntary standards bodies (Verra, Gold Standard, American Carbon Registry, Climate Action Reserve).
- **Price**: Compliance credits are priced by regulated markets — EU ETS allowances trade around €60-80/tonne. Voluntary offsets range from under $5/tonne (low-quality avoidance) to $200+/tonne (high-quality carbon removal).
- **Legal standing**: Compliance credits have legal force — companies must surrender them to cover emissions. Voluntary offsets have no legal standing unless a specific regulation accepts them.

## What are Carbon Credits?

Carbon credits in the compliance context are emission allowances issued under regulated cap-and-trade systems. The government sets an emissions cap for covered sectors, allocates or auctions allowances (each worth one tonne of CO₂e), and requires companies to surrender enough allowances to cover their actual emissions.

The EU Emissions Trading System (EU ETS) is the world's largest compliance carbon market, covering power generation, heavy industry, aviation within Europe, and (from 2024) maritime transport. Companies receive free allocations based on benchmarks and buy additional allowances at auction or on the secondary market. The cap decreases annually, forcing aggregate emission reductions across the economy.

Other major compliance markets include California's cap-and-trade system (linked with Quebec), the UK ETS, South Korea's ETS, China's national ETS, and the Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative (RGGI) covering US northeastern states. Each has different rules about allocation, trading, offsets, and penalties.

Compliance credits have clear economic properties. They're scarce (the cap limits supply), tradable (creating price signals), and enforceable (penalties for non-surrender exceed the credit price). This combination creates genuine financial incentive to reduce emissions — it's cheaper to invest in efficiency than to keep buying increasingly expensive allowances.

Article 6 of the Paris Agreement is creating new mechanisms for international carbon credit trading between countries, though implementation details are still being finalized. Article 6.2 covers bilateral agreements for Internationally Transferred Mitigation Outcomes (ITMOs). Article 6.4 establishes a new UN-supervised crediting mechanism replacing the Clean Development Mechanism.

## What are Carbon Offsets?

Carbon offsets are credits generated by projects that reduce, avoid, or remove greenhouse gas emissions. They're purchased voluntarily by companies, organizations, and individuals to compensate for their own emissions. Each offset represents one tonne of CO₂ equivalent reduced or removed.

Offset projects fall into two broad categories. **Avoidance offsets** prevent emissions that would otherwise have occurred — protecting a forest from logging (REDD+), replacing diesel generators with solar panels, distributing clean cookstoves. **Removal offsets** actively pull CO₂ from the atmosphere — afforestation, direct air capture, enhanced rock weathering, biochar.

Major voluntary offset standards include Verra's Verified Carbon Standard (VCS), Gold Standard, American Carbon Registry, and Climate Action Reserve. These standards set requirements for additionality (the reduction wouldn't have happened without offset revenue), permanence (the reduction is durable), no leakage (emissions aren't just displaced elsewhere), and conservative quantification.

The voluntary carbon market grew rapidly through the early 2020s, reaching nearly $2 billion in transaction value. But a series of investigative reports — particularly about overestimated REDD+ forest offsets — triggered a credibility crisis. Analysis by academic researchers and journalists found that many forest protection offsets dramatically overstated the deforestation risk they claimed to prevent, meaning the credited emission reductions never actually occurred.

This credibility crisis is reshaping the market. The Integrity Council for the Voluntary Carbon Market (ICVCM) launched its Core Carbon Principles to define high-quality credits. The Voluntary Carbon Markets Integrity Initiative (VCMI) published guidance on credible corporate offset use. Buyers are shifting toward removal credits with stronger permanence guarantees, and prices for high-quality offsets are rising.

## Key Differences

- **Regulatory backing**: Compliance credits are backed by law — governments enforce surrender obligations and penalize non-compliance. Offsets are contractual instruments with no inherent legal authority unless a specific regulation accepts them.
- **Additionality assurance**: In compliance markets, additionality is structural — the cap creates scarcity regardless of individual projects. In voluntary markets, additionality must be demonstrated project-by-project, which is where quality issues arise. Would that forest have been logged without offset funding? The answer is often less clear than claimed.
- **Cap vs. no cap**: Compliance markets operate under binding emission caps that decrease over time, guaranteeing aggregate reductions. Voluntary offset purchases have no aggregate cap — total emissions can rise even as offset purchases increase.
- **Price discovery**: Compliance credit prices are set by liquid, regulated markets with transparent trading. Offset prices are set by bilateral negotiation, broker intermediation, and registry marketplaces — less transparent, more variable.
- **Use in claims**: Compliance credits satisfy legal emission obligations. Offsets support voluntary claims (carbon neutrality, emission compensation) that face increasing regulatory and public scrutiny. The EU Green Claims Directive restricts product-level claims based on offsets.
- **Quality variance**: Compliance credits within a given market are functionally identical — one EU ETS allowance is worth the same as another. Offsets vary dramatically in quality — a high-quality direct air capture removal credit bears little resemblance to a cheap avoidance offset with questionable additionality.

## When to Use Each

**You'll use compliance credits when:**
- Your operations fall under a regulated cap-and-trade system
- You need to surrender allowances to meet legal emission obligations
- You're trading in compliance markets as part of carbon portfolio management
- Article 6 mechanisms create new compliance opportunities for your country or sector

**Consider voluntary offsets when:**
- You've already reduced emissions through operational changes and need to address residual emissions
- Your corporate climate commitment includes emission compensation or contribution claims
- You're pursuing carbon neutrality as an interim step toward net zero
- You want to channel climate finance to high-quality removal projects beyond your value chain

**Approach offsets carefully:**
- Prioritize removal credits (afforestation, biochar, direct air capture) over avoidance credits
- Require third-party verification under recognized standards (Gold Standard, Verra with ICVCM Core Carbon Principles)
- Never use offsets as a substitute for operational emission reductions
- Disclose offset use transparently — specify project types, volumes, standards, and the role offsets play in your overall climate strategy

## Council Fire's Recommendation

The distinction between compliance credits and voluntary offsets matters because the credibility gap between them is wide and growing. Compliance markets work — the EU ETS has driven measurable emission reductions across European industry. Voluntary offsets work when they're high-quality, but the market's track record on quality has been uneven.

For corporate climate strategy, follow a clear hierarchy: reduce emissions first, invest in your value chain second, and use offsets only for genuinely residual emissions you cannot yet eliminate. When you do buy offsets, pay for quality — high-integrity removal credits from verified projects with strong additionality and permanence. Cheap avoidance offsets are not worth the reputational risk.

Council Fire helps companies develop carbon management strategies that integrate compliance obligations with credible voluntary action — building the data infrastructure, reduction pathways, and procurement criteria to make carbon credits and offsets work within a defensible climate strategy.
