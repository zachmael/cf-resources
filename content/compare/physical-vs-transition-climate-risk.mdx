faqs:
  - question: "Can a company face both physical and transition risks simultaneously?"
    answer: "Yes, and most do. A fossil fuel company faces transition risk from decarbonization policies AND physical risk from extreme weather affecting extraction operations. A real estate firm faces physical risk from flooding AND transition risk from building energy efficiency regulations. Comprehensive climate risk assessment must evaluate both."
  - question: "Which type of risk is more financially material?"
    answer: "It depends entirely on sector, geography, and time horizon. Energy companies face enormous transition risk from policy and technology shifts. Coastal real estate faces significant physical risk from sea level rise. Agricultural companies face both. Financial institutions face both through their lending and investment portfolios. There's no universal answer."
  - question: "How do I quantify these risks?"
    answer: "Physical risk quantification uses climate models, hazard mapping, and asset-level exposure analysis. Transition risk quantification uses scenario analysis — modeling financial impacts under different policy, technology, and market assumptions (e.g., IEA Net Zero, NGFS scenarios). Both require translating climate scenarios into financial metrics: revenue impact, asset impairment, insurance costs, capital requirements."
  - question: "What's the relationship between these risks?"
    answer: "They're inversely correlated across scenarios. Strong climate action (aggressive policy, rapid technology transition) increases transition risk but reduces long-term physical risk by limiting warming. Weak climate action reduces near-term transition risk but increases physical risk as warming accelerates. Companies must stress-test their strategy across both high-transition and high-physical-risk scenarios."
  - question: "Do disclosure frameworks treat them differently?"
    answer: "TCFD, ISSB, CSRD, and SEC requirements all require separate disclosure of physical and transition risks. Scenario analysis typically models at least two scenarios — one high-transition (orderly or disorderly decarbonization) and one high-physical-risk (limited policy action, higher warming). Best practice is to assess three or more scenarios covering the range of outcomes."

## Quick Comparison

- **Physical risks**: Direct impacts from climate change — acute events (hurricanes, floods, wildfires, heatwaves) and chronic shifts (sea level rise, changing precipitation patterns, temperature increases, water stress). Affect assets, operations, supply chains, and workforce.
- **Transition risks**: Financial impacts from the shift to a low-carbon economy — policy changes (carbon pricing, emissions regulations), technology disruption (renewable energy, EVs), market shifts (changing consumer preferences), and reputation effects (stakeholder pressure).
- **Time horizon**: Physical risks intensify over decades, though acute events already cause significant losses. Transition risks can materialize rapidly — a policy announcement or technology breakthrough can shift asset values overnight.
- **Controllability**: Companies can reduce physical risk exposure through adaptation measures and location decisions. Companies can reduce transition risk through decarbonization, business model innovation, and strategic positioning.
- **Scenario relationship**: Higher policy ambition = higher transition risk, lower long-term physical risk. Lower policy ambition = lower transition risk, higher physical risk. No scenario eliminates both.

## What are Physical Climate Risks?

Physical climate risks are the tangible impacts of a changing climate on business operations, assets, supply chains, and people. They divide into acute risks — discrete weather events that are intensifying — and chronic risks — long-term shifts in climate patterns.

Acute physical risks include increasingly severe hurricanes and typhoons, more intense precipitation and flooding, longer and more destructive wildfire seasons, extreme heat events, and drought. These events cause direct damage to assets and infrastructure, disrupt operations and supply chains, increase insurance costs, and create workforce health and safety challenges.

Chronic physical risks include sea level rise, sustained temperature increases, shifting precipitation patterns, ocean acidification, permafrost thaw, and growing water stress in vulnerable regions. These slower-moving changes affect asset values, agricultural productivity, energy demand patterns, and the viability of certain business locations over decades.

The financial consequences are already substantial. Insured natural catastrophe losses exceeded $100 billion globally in both 2023 and 2024. The uninsured losses are multiples higher. Munich Re, Swiss Re, and other reinsurers have documented the trend of rising climate-related losses and are repricing risk accordingly — increasing premiums, restricting coverage, or withdrawing from high-risk markets entirely.

Physical risk assessment requires understanding where your assets, operations, suppliers, and customers are located relative to climate hazards. This involves geographic analysis at the asset level, climate model projections under different warming scenarios (1.5°C, 2°C, 3°C+), and financial modeling that translates hazard exposure into business impact.

## What are Transition Climate Risks?

Transition risks arise from the economic, policy, and social adjustments required to move toward a low-carbon economy. They affect companies through four channels:

**Policy and legal risks** include carbon pricing mechanisms, emissions regulations, energy efficiency mandates, fossil fuel subsidy removal, and climate-related litigation. The EU Emissions Trading System prices carbon at €50-100 per tonne. Over 70 jurisdictions have carbon pricing instruments. Climate litigation cases have exceeded 2,600 globally, with an increasing success rate for plaintiffs.

**Technology risks** include the displacement of incumbent technologies by cleaner alternatives. Solar and wind are now cheaper than fossil fuel generation in most markets. Electric vehicle market share is growing rapidly. Energy storage, green hydrogen, and carbon capture technologies are scaling. Companies relying on carbon-intensive technologies face asset stranding and competitive displacement.

**Market risks** include shifting consumer preferences toward sustainable products, changing investor expectations (ESG integration, divestment campaigns), and evolving supply chain requirements as large buyers impose emissions reduction demands on suppliers. These market shifts can reduce demand for carbon-intensive products and services.

**Reputation risks** include stakeholder pressure from activists, employees, customers, and communities demanding climate action. Companies perceived as climate laggards face recruitment challenges, consumer boycotts, and investor engagement campaigns. Social license to operate increasingly depends on credible climate strategy.

## Key Differences

**Nature of impact.** Physical risks damage tangible assets and disrupt operations — a flooded factory, a drought-affected supply chain, a heat-stressed workforce. Transition risks affect financial and strategic positioning — a stranded fossil fuel asset, a carbon tax increasing operating costs, a technology shift making your product obsolete. Physical risks are about what climate does to you. Transition risks are about what the response to climate does to you.

**Time dynamics.** Physical risks follow climate science — they intensify with warming, with acute events already occurring against a backdrop of chronic change. Transition risks follow policy and market dynamics — they can materialize suddenly when a government announces new regulation or a competitor launches a disruptive technology. Physical risk is a slow build with spikes. Transition risk can be a step change.

**Geographic specificity.** Physical risks are highly location-dependent. A facility in Miami faces different physical risks than one in Minnesota. Transition risks are more systemic — carbon pricing affects an entire economy, technology shifts affect an entire sector regardless of location. Physical risk assessment requires granular geographic analysis; transition risk assessment requires sectoral and policy analysis.

**Scenario correlation.** In a 1.5°C-aligned scenario (strong policy action), transition risks are high but long-term physical risks are moderated. In a 3°C+ scenario (weak policy action), transition risks are lower but physical risks become severe and potentially catastrophic. No scenario is risk-free — companies must build resilience across the range.

**Management approach.** Physical risk management involves adaptation: hardening infrastructure, diversifying supply chains, relocating assets, purchasing insurance, and building operational resilience. Transition risk management involves transformation: decarbonizing operations, pivoting business models, investing in clean technology, and positioning for a low-carbon economy.

## When to Focus on Each

**Prioritize physical risk if**: you have significant fixed assets in climate-vulnerable locations, your supply chain depends on agriculture or water-intensive processes, you operate in sectors where physical disruption directly impacts revenue (real estate, agriculture, tourism, insurance), or you're conducting due diligence on a long-lived asset investment.

**Prioritize transition risk if**: you're in a carbon-intensive sector (energy, heavy industry, transportation, materials), your business model depends on fossil fuels or high-emission processes, you operate in jurisdictions actively implementing climate policy, or your customers and investors are demanding decarbonization.

**Assess both comprehensively if**: you're conducting a TCFD-aligned climate risk assessment, preparing for CSRD or SEC climate disclosure, or developing a climate strategy. All major disclosure frameworks require evaluation of both physical and transition risks across multiple scenarios.

## Council Fire's Perspective

The companies we see make the biggest strategic mistakes are those that only assess one type of risk. Oil and gas companies obsess over transition risk (rightly) but underestimate physical risk to their extraction and processing infrastructure. Real estate companies focus on physical risk (flooding, heat) but ignore transition risk from building performance regulations and energy efficiency mandates.

We run scenario analyses across at least three pathways — orderly transition, disorderly transition, and hot house world — because reality will land somewhere in this range, and companies need strategies that are resilient across outcomes rather than optimized for a single scenario. The goal isn't predicting the future; it's stress-testing your business against the plausible range of futures and identifying vulnerabilities you can address now.
