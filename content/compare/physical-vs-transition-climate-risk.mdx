faqs:
  - question: "Which type of climate risk is more urgent?"
    answer: "Both are urgent, but on different timelines. Physical risks are already materializing — extreme weather events, sea level rise, and water stress are causing measurable financial losses now. Transition risks accelerate as policy tightens and technology shifts. For most companies, transition risks (especially regulatory and market shifts) will hit the balance sheet sooner than chronic physical risks, though acute physical events can strike at any time."
  - question: "Do I need to assess both types?"
    answer: "Yes. TCFD, ISSB (IFRS S2), CSRD, and the SEC climate rule all expect disclosure of both physical and transition risks. Scenario analysis under these frameworks typically requires evaluating your business under at least two scenarios — a high-warming scenario (more physical risk) and an orderly transition scenario (more transition risk). Assessing only one type gives an incomplete picture."
  - question: "How do physical and transition risks interact?"
    answer: "They're inversely correlated at the macro level. If the world transitions aggressively to low-carbon (limiting warming), transition risks are high but physical risks are lower. If transition stalls, physical risks escalate dramatically. At the company level, you may face both simultaneously — a coastal facility exposed to flooding AND a carbon-intensive product line facing regulatory phase-out."
  - question: "What data do I need for climate risk assessment?"
    answer: "For physical risk: asset-level location data, climate hazard projections (flood maps, heat stress models, wildfire exposure), insurance loss data, and supply chain geographic mapping. For transition risk: carbon pricing scenarios, regulatory pipeline analysis, technology cost curves, market demand forecasts, and competitor strategy intelligence."

## Quick Comparison

- **Definition**: Physical risk comes from the direct effects of climate change on assets, operations, and supply chains. Transition risk comes from the economic and policy shifts involved in moving to a low-carbon economy.
- **Subtypes**: Physical risk divides into acute (event-driven: hurricanes, floods, wildfires) and chronic (long-term shifts: rising temperatures, sea level rise, water scarcity). Transition risk divides into policy/legal, technology, market, and reputation categories.
- **Time horizon**: Acute physical risks are present today and intensifying. Chronic physical risks compound over decades. Transition risks are accelerating now as regulations tighten and clean technology costs fall.
- **Who's most exposed**: Physical risk hits asset-heavy industries with fixed locations — real estate, agriculture, utilities, manufacturing, insurance. Transition risk hits carbon-intensive industries — fossil fuels, heavy industry, transportation, materials.
- **Measurement**: Physical risk is assessed through climate models, hazard mapping, and asset-level exposure analysis. Transition risk is assessed through scenario analysis, carbon pricing models, and regulatory pipeline tracking.

## What is Physical Climate Risk?

Physical climate risk refers to the financial impact of climate change's direct effects on business operations, assets, supply chains, and workforce. It splits into two categories.

**Acute physical risks** are event-driven. Hurricanes, floods, wildfires, heatwaves, and storms that damage property, disrupt operations, and break supply chains. Hurricane Ian (2022) caused $113 billion in damages. The 2021 Texas freeze disrupted energy and manufacturing across the state. These events are growing in frequency and severity as global temperatures rise.

**Chronic physical risks** are gradual shifts. Rising sea levels threatening coastal infrastructure. Increasing average temperatures reducing agricultural yields and labor productivity. Changing precipitation patterns disrupting water availability for manufacturing and cooling. Permafrost thaw destabilizing Arctic infrastructure. These risks compound over years and decades, making some locations and business models unviable.

Physical risk assessment requires granular, location-specific analysis. A global manufacturer needs to map every facility, warehouse, and key supplier against climate hazard projections. Flood risk in Houston is different from drought risk in Phoenix is different from typhoon exposure in Manila. Generic assessments miss the point — physical risk is fundamentally local.

Insurance is the traditional hedge against physical risk, but the insurance market is repricing rapidly. Insurers are withdrawing from high-risk regions (Florida homeowners, California wildfire zones), premiums are spiking, and some risks are becoming uninsurable. Companies that relied on insurance as their physical risk strategy are discovering it's no longer reliable or affordable.

## What is Transition Climate Risk?

Transition climate risk captures the financial impact of the shift to a low-carbon economy. As governments, markets, and societies move to address climate change, businesses face four categories of transition risk.

**Policy and legal risk**: Carbon pricing (taxes or cap-and-trade), emissions regulations, building efficiency mandates, vehicle emissions standards, methane regulations, deforestation rules, and climate litigation. The EU Carbon Border Adjustment Mechanism (CBAM) is already repricing carbon-intensive imports. Climate litigation has exceeded 2,600 cases globally.

**Technology risk**: Clean technology disrupting incumbent business models. Electric vehicles replacing internal combustion engines. Renewable energy undercutting fossil fuel economics. Heat pumps displacing gas boilers. Green hydrogen competing with grey. Companies invested in legacy technology face stranded assets if they don't adapt.

**Market risk**: Shifting consumer preferences, changing investor expectations, and evolving supply chain requirements. Procurement departments demanding Scope 3 data from suppliers. Consumers choosing lower-carbon products. Investors divesting from high-carbon portfolios or demanding transition plans.

**Reputation risk**: Stakeholder pressure on companies perceived as blocking or delaying climate action. Greenwashing backlash against companies making unsupported claims. Employee activism and recruitment challenges at companies without credible climate strategies.

Transition risks accelerate non-linearly. Policy can shift quickly — a new regulation can strand billions in assets overnight. Technology cost curves can cross tipping points where incumbents become uncompetitive within years. Companies that view transition as gradual and predictable are the most vulnerable to disruption.

## Key Differences

- **Controllability**: Physical risks are external — you can't prevent a hurricane. You can only prepare, adapt, and build resilience. Transition risks are partially controllable — you can invest in decarbonization, develop clean products, and align with policy direction.
- **Scenario relationship**: Physical and transition risks are inversely related at the global level. Aggressive climate action (1.5°C pathway) increases transition risk but limits physical risk. Policy failure (3°C+ warming) reduces near-term transition pressure but unleashes severe physical consequences.
- **Asset impact**: Physical risk damages or destroys existing assets. Transition risk strands assets that become economically unviable — fossil fuel reserves that can't be burned, gas pipelines without demand, factories that can't meet emissions standards.
- **Geographic concentration**: Physical risk is highly location-specific. Transition risk is sector-specific — it follows carbon intensity regardless of geography.
- **Hedging options**: Physical risk can be partially hedged through insurance, diversification, and engineering controls. Transition risk is hedged through strategic repositioning, R&D investment, and portfolio diversification toward low-carbon activities.
- **Data maturity**: Physical risk modeling is relatively advanced — decades of climate science and catastrophe modeling. Transition risk modeling is less mature, relying on scenario assumptions about policy, technology, and market behavior that are inherently uncertain.

## When to Focus on Each

**Prioritize physical risk assessment when:**
- Your business has significant fixed assets in climate-vulnerable locations
- Supply chain reliability depends on specific geographic regions
- Insurance costs are rising or coverage is becoming unavailable
- You're making long-duration capital allocation decisions (20+ year infrastructure)
- Your sector depends on natural resources sensitive to climate variability (agriculture, water, forestry)

**Prioritize transition risk assessment when:**
- Your business model depends on carbon-intensive activities
- Regulatory changes in your sector are accelerating
- Clean technology alternatives to your products or processes are maturing
- Your customers or investors are demanding decarbonization commitments
- You're in a sector facing carbon pricing, border adjustments, or phase-out timelines

**Always assess both when:**
- You're conducting scenario analysis for TCFD, ISSB, or CSRD disclosure
- You're developing corporate climate strategy
- You're making capital allocation decisions that span multiple decades

## Council Fire's Recommendation

Most companies underestimate transition risk because it feels abstract until it hits. A carbon border tax, a competitor's breakthrough clean product, or a major customer requiring Scope 3 data from suppliers can restructure competitive dynamics fast. Physical risk gets attention because it's visceral — everyone understands a flood — but transition risk often has larger near-term financial implications.

Build your climate risk assessment to cover both types across multiple time horizons. Use scenario analysis that stress-tests your business under at least a 1.5°C orderly transition scenario and a 3°C+ high-warming scenario. The goal isn't prediction — it's preparedness.

Council Fire helps companies build climate risk assessment frameworks that integrate physical and transition risks into strategic planning, capital allocation, and regulatory disclosure — producing analysis that satisfies TCFD, ISSB, and CSRD requirements while actually informing business decisions.
