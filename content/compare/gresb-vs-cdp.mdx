## What is GRESB?

GRESB (formerly the Global Real Estate Sustainability Benchmark) is the leading ESG benchmark for real estate and infrastructure investments. Founded in 2009 by a group of pension funds that wanted comparable ESG data on their real asset portfolios, GRESB has grown into the standard assessment for the sector. Over 170 institutional investors—including APG, PGGM, CalPERS, and the Abu Dhabi Investment Authority—use GRESB data to evaluate and monitor their real asset investments.

GRESB operates two main assessments: the Real Estate Assessment and the Infrastructure Assessment. Both evaluate participants on Management (policies, governance, stakeholder engagement, risk management) and Performance (energy, GHG emissions, water, waste, biodiversity, and social indicators at the asset level). Companies and funds submit data annually, which GRESB validates and scores on a 0-100 scale. Participants receive peer comparisons within sector, geography, and strategy-specific benchmarks.

What makes GRESB distinctive is its asset-level granularity. While most ESG ratings evaluate companies at the corporate level, GRESB drills into individual buildings, portfolios, and infrastructure assets. This matters enormously for real estate and infrastructure investors who need to assess the ESG performance of specific assets within a fund—not just the fund manager's corporate policies. GRESB data can reveal, for example, that a REIT has excellent energy efficiency in its office portfolio but poor water management in its retail properties.

## What is CDP?

CDP runs the world's leading environmental disclosure system, collecting standardized data from companies, cities, and regions on climate change, water security, and forests. Companies respond to detailed questionnaires and receive letter grades from A (Leadership) to D- (Disclosure), with the process backed by over 740 institutional investors representing $136 trillion in assets.

CDP's climate change questionnaire is the most comprehensive corporate climate disclosure instrument available, covering governance, strategy, risks and opportunities, targets, Scope 1/2/3 emissions, and verification. The water security questionnaire assesses water risk exposure, management, and governance. The forests questionnaire evaluates commodity-linked deforestation risks and management.

CDP's influence extends well beyond individual company scores. CDP data feeds into major ESG ratings (MSCI, Sustainalytics, S&P Global all use CDP data), benchmarks (the Climate Action 100+ Net-Zero Company Benchmark references CDP disclosures), and regulatory alignment tools (CDP questionnaires are aligned with TCFD and ISSB frameworks). For many companies, CDP disclosure serves as the foundation of their broader environmental reporting.

## Key Differences

**1. Sector Specificity vs. Universal Coverage.** GRESB is purpose-built for real estate and infrastructure—its indicators, benchmarks, and scoring are calibrated to the unique characteristics of real assets. CDP covers all sectors universally. A real estate company responding to CDP uses the same climate questionnaire as a pharmaceutical company or a bank. GRESB provides sector-specific granularity that CDP's cross-sector design doesn't match for real assets.

**2. Assessment Level.** GRESB assesses at the entity, fund, and asset level—producing data on individual buildings and infrastructure assets. CDP assesses at the corporate level—a company's aggregate climate, water, or forest performance. For real asset investors who need to understand the ESG performance of specific properties within a portfolio, GRESB provides granularity that CDP doesn't.

**3. ESG Breadth vs. Environmental Depth.** GRESB covers environmental, social, and governance factors specific to real assets—including tenant engagement, health and safety, community impact, and governance of sustainability programs. CDP focuses exclusively on environmental topics—climate, water, and forests—with far greater depth on emissions accounting, science-based targets, and climate scenario analysis.

**4. Investor Base.** GRESB serves real asset investors—pension funds, sovereign wealth funds, and institutional allocators with direct exposure to property and infrastructure. CDP serves the broad institutional investor community across all asset classes. A pension fund with a large real estate allocation likely uses both: CDP for its public equity and fixed-income portfolios, GRESB for its real asset allocations.

**5. Participation Model.** GRESB is a paid assessment—participants pay fees to submit data and receive benchmarking reports. CDP disclosure is free for companies, with revenue coming from investor and supply chain memberships. This creates different adoption dynamics: GRESB participation is a deliberate strategic decision, while CDP disclosure carries lower barriers to entry.

**6. Benchmarking Approach.** GRESB provides detailed peer comparisons within highly specific groups—office REITs in Europe, diversified infrastructure funds in Asia-Pacific, residential developers globally. This sector-geography-strategy specificity makes GRESB benchmarks directly actionable. CDP provides sector-based comparison but at a broader level that doesn't distinguish between, say, a logistics REIT and a retail REIT.

**7. Data Output.** GRESB produces numerical scores, star ratings (1-5 stars), and quadrant positioning (by management and performance). CDP produces letter grades. Both are used in investment decisions, but GRESB's numerical scores allow more granular differentiation among peers—important in real asset markets where investors compare a limited number of fund options.

## Which One Do You Need?

If you're a real estate company, REIT, infrastructure fund, or real asset manager, GRESB is the sector-specific benchmark your investors expect. Most major institutional real asset investors—pension funds, sovereign wealth funds, endowments—use GRESB as a standard component of due diligence and portfolio monitoring. Not participating puts you at a disadvantage in capital raising.

If you have significant environmental exposure—carbon emissions, energy use, water consumption, deforestation-linked supply chains—CDP provides the most recognized platform for transparent environmental disclosure. CDP is sector-agnostic, so whether you're in real estate, manufacturing, finance, or agriculture, the platform applies.

Real estate and infrastructure companies should strongly consider both. GRESB provides the sector-specific benchmarking and asset-level analysis your direct investors want. CDP provides the environmental disclosure depth that broader ESG rating agencies incorporate into your corporate scores. Many GRESB participants find that data collected for GRESB—energy consumption, emissions, water use at the asset level—directly supports CDP climate and water disclosures. Preparing for both simultaneously is more efficient than tackling them separately.

## Council Fire's Perspective

For real asset clients, we view GRESB as non-negotiable and CDP as highly strategic. GRESB is where your sector's investors look first—it's the common language for ESG performance in property and infrastructure. CDP adds the environmental credibility and cross-sector comparability that strengthens your position with lenders, tenants, and the broader investment community.

The operational synergy between the two assessments is significant and underappreciated. Both require asset-level energy, emissions, water, and waste data. Companies that build centralized sustainability data platforms—collecting utility data, emissions factors, and performance metrics at the building or asset level—can efficiently feed both GRESB and CDP from a single data source. We help clients build this infrastructure once and leverage it across all reporting obligations.

## Frequently Asked Questions

### Can GRESB data be used for CDP reporting?
Yes, and this is common practice. Asset-level energy consumption, GHG emissions, water withdrawal, and waste generation data collected for GRESB maps directly onto CDP questionnaire requirements. The emissions accounting methodologies are compatible (both reference the GHG Protocol). Companies that centralize their environmental data collection can efficiently prepare both submissions, though CDP requires additional detail on governance, strategy, scenario analysis, and science-based targets that goes beyond GRESB's scope.

### Which assessment is harder to score well on?
They test different things. GRESB rewards both management quality (policies, governance, systems) and performance outcomes (actual reductions in energy, emissions, water, waste). Companies with mature sustainability programs and strong operational data tend to score well. CDP rewards disclosure completeness, management processes, and leadership ambition—companies need to demonstrate comprehensive climate governance, set science-based targets, and show year-over-year progress. Achieving CDP A-List status requires exceptional disclosure and leadership-level ambition. Achieving a GRESB 5-Star rating requires top-quintile performance. Both demand sustained effort.

### Do GRESB scores affect property valuations?
Emerging evidence suggests yes. Research from GRESB and academic institutions has found positive correlations between GRESB scores and financial metrics including rental premiums, lower vacancy rates, and lower capitalization rates for green-certified buildings. Investors increasingly use GRESB data in asset valuation models, and some lenders offer sustainability-linked loan terms tied to GRESB performance. While causation is difficult to isolate, the trend toward ESG-adjusted property valuation is clear.

### Is GRESB expanding beyond real estate and infrastructure?
GRESB has steadily expanded within the real assets space—adding developer assessments, standing investment assessments for infrastructure, and increasing geographic coverage. As of 2025, the core focus remains real estate and infrastructure. There's no indication of expansion into unrelated sectors, which is arguably a strength—GRESB's value lies in its sector-specific expertise and peer benchmarking within real assets.
