faqs:
  - question: "Can a company have B Corp certification and a poor ESG rating?"
    answer: "Yes, and it happens. B Corp measures verified impact across stakeholders using B Lab's assessment. ESG ratings from MSCI, Sustainalytics, or S&P Global evaluate risk exposure and management. A small B Corp with strong social practices but limited climate disclosure could score poorly on ESG ratings that weight environmental data heavily."
  - question: "Which one do investors care about more?"
    answer: "Institutional investors primarily use ESG ratings because they're integrated into financial analysis platforms and cover thousands of companies. B Corp certification matters more to impact investors, conscious consumers, and values-aligned partners. If you're raising from ESG-focused funds, ratings matter. If you're building a mission-driven brand, B Corp carries weight."
  - question: "How much does each cost?"
    answer: "B Corp certification fees range from $1,000 to $50,000+ annually based on revenue, plus significant internal effort for the assessment. ESG ratings are typically free — rating agencies assess companies using public data and questionnaires. However, improving your ESG score may require substantial investment in data systems, reporting infrastructure, and sustainability programs."
  - question: "Is B Corp certification a substitute for ESG reporting?"
    answer: "No. B Corp certification demonstrates verified social and environmental performance but doesn't satisfy regulatory ESG disclosure requirements like CSRD, SEC climate rules, or stock exchange listing requirements. You may need both — B Corp for brand positioning and stakeholder trust, plus formal ESG reporting for regulatory compliance and investor expectations."

## Quick Comparison

- **Who runs it**: B Corp certification is managed by B Lab, a single nonprofit. ESG ratings come from multiple competing agencies — MSCI, Sustainalytics (Morningstar), S&P Global, ISS, and others.
- **What it measures**: B Corp assesses verified positive impact on workers, community, environment, customers, and governance. ESG ratings assess how well a company manages ESG-related financial risks and opportunities.
- **How you get rated**: B Corp requires companies to apply, complete the B Impact Assessment (BIA), score 80+ out of 200, undergo verification, and amend legal governing documents. ESG ratings are assigned by agencies — most companies are rated without requesting it.
- **Who pays**: Companies pay B Lab for certification. ESG rating agencies charge investors for data access — companies are rated for free (though some agencies sell advisory services).
- **Coverage**: About 9,000 certified B Corps globally as of 2025. MSCI alone rates 8,500+ companies; Sustainalytics covers 20,000+.

## What is B Corp Certification?

B Corp certification verifies that a company meets high standards of social and environmental performance, accountability, and transparency. B Lab, the certifying nonprofit, administers the B Impact Assessment — a detailed questionnaire covering five areas: governance, workers, community, environment, and customers.

To earn certification, a company must score at least 80 out of 200 on the BIA, provide documentation for verification, and legally commit to considering all stakeholders (not just shareholders) in decision-making. This legal requirement means amending articles of incorporation or operating agreements — a structural commitment that goes beyond policy statements.

The recertification process happens every three years, with updated standards. B Lab has tightened requirements over time, and some well-known B Corps have lost certification when they couldn't meet raised bars. The 2024 standards overhaul introduced more rigorous requirements around climate action and living wages.

B Corp certification is voluntary and self-initiated. No company gets certified without choosing to pursue it. This self-selection means B Corps tend to be mission-driven companies — often small to midsize — that view social and environmental performance as core to their identity.

## What are ESG Ratings?

ESG ratings are scores assigned by third-party agencies that evaluate a company's exposure to environmental, social, and governance risks and how effectively those risks are managed. The major rating providers — MSCI, Sustainalytics, S&P Global CSA, ISS ESG, and CDP — each use proprietary methodologies, which is why ratings for the same company can differ significantly across agencies.

Most ESG ratings are unsolicited. Agencies collect data from public filings, sustainability reports, news sources, and company questionnaires, then apply their scoring models. Companies can engage with the process (responding to questionnaires, providing additional data) but cannot control the outcome.

ESG ratings serve primarily as tools for institutional investors. Asset managers use them to screen portfolios, benchmark holdings, assess risk, and meet their own ESG mandates. The ratings industry has grown rapidly — assets under management using ESG criteria exceeded $30 trillion globally.

A persistent criticism of ESG ratings is low correlation between agencies. Research consistently shows that the same company can receive a top score from one agency and a mediocre score from another. This divergence stems from different materiality definitions, weighting schemes, data sources, and methodological approaches.

## Key Differences

- **Purpose**: B Corp certification validates positive impact and stakeholder commitment. ESG ratings quantify risk management for investors.
- **Methodology transparency**: B Lab publishes its full assessment framework. Most ESG rating agencies keep their detailed methodologies proprietary, though they publish general frameworks.
- **Consistency**: B Corp has one standard, one certifier, one score. ESG ratings vary wildly across providers — a company rated AAA by MSCI might be rated medium-risk by Sustainalytics.
- **Size bias**: ESG ratings favor large companies with dedicated sustainability teams and extensive public disclosure. B Corp certification is accessible to companies of all sizes, with simplified assessments for smaller firms.
- **Legal commitment**: B Corp requires legal structural changes to governance documents. ESG ratings require no legal commitments whatsoever.
- **Sector coverage**: ESG ratings cover virtually all publicly traded companies and many large private ones. B Corp certification skews heavily toward private, small-to-midsize, consumer-facing businesses.
- **Dynamic vs. static**: ESG ratings update continuously as new data emerges. B Corp certification is a point-in-time assessment with three-year recertification cycles.

## When to Use Each

**Pursue B Corp certification when:**
- Your company is mission-driven and you want external validation of that commitment
- You're targeting conscious consumers, impact investors, or values-aligned B2B partners
- You want a structured framework to improve social and environmental performance across your entire business
- You're willing to make legal governance changes that embed stakeholder consideration into your corporate structure
- Brand differentiation in your market depends on verified social responsibility credentials

**Focus on ESG ratings when:**
- You're publicly traded or seeking institutional investment
- Your investors or lenders require ESG data for portfolio analysis
- You need to benchmark against industry peers on ESG risk management
- Regulatory requirements (like CSRD or SEC rules) mandate ESG-related disclosure that feeds into ratings
- You're competing for inclusion in ESG indices or sustainable investment funds

**Pursue both when:**
- You're a mission-driven company scaling to institutional capital markets
- You want both verified impact credentials and strong risk-management positioning
- Your stakeholder base includes both conscious consumers and ESG-focused investors

## Council Fire's Recommendation

Don't treat these as interchangeable. B Corp certification proves you're building a business that serves all stakeholders. ESG ratings show investors you're managing material risks. Both have value, but for different audiences.

If you're a private, mission-driven company under $500M in revenue, B Corp certification likely delivers more practical value — it structures your impact work, differentiates your brand, and opens doors with aligned partners and customers. ESG ratings may not even cover you.

If you're publicly traded or raising institutional capital, ESG ratings are unavoidable — investors use them whether you engage or not. Proactively managing your ESG data and engaging with rating agencies improves your scores and access to capital.

For companies that qualify for both, the combination is powerful. B Corp certification demonstrates genuine commitment; strong ESG ratings demonstrate professional risk management. Together, they tell a story that neither tells alone.

Council Fire helps companies determine which path fits their business model, stakeholder expectations, and growth strategy — and build the data infrastructure to support both if needed.
