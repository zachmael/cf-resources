faqs:
  - question: "Are self-set targets always weaker than science-based targets?"
    answer: "Not necessarily, but they usually are. A well-designed self-set target covering all scopes with an ambitious reduction pathway could exceed SBTi requirements. The problem is there's no external check — and research shows that most self-set targets are insufficiently ambitious, exclude Scope 3, or rely heavily on offsets. Without validation, you can't tell the credible self-set targets from the greenwash."
  - question: "How much does SBTi validation cost?"
    answer: "SBTi charges target validation fees on a sliding scale based on company revenue: $1,000-$9,500 for most companies, up to $14,500 for the largest. The bigger cost is internal — building the emissions inventory, modeling reduction pathways, and engaging leadership typically requires 6-12 months of staff time and potentially consultant support."
  - question: "What if SBTi rejects my targets?"
    answer: "SBTi provides feedback and allows resubmission. Common rejection reasons include insufficient scope coverage (excluding material Scope 3 categories), insufficient ambition (not aligned with 1.5°C), or reliance on offsets for target achievement. Most companies iterate 1-2 times before validation. The process is collaborative, not adversarial."
  - question: "Do customers and investors distinguish between the two?"
    answer: "Increasingly, yes. CDP's scoring methodology gives higher marks for SBTi-validated targets. Investor coalitions like Climate Action 100+ explicitly track SBTi commitments. Enterprise procurement teams are adding SBTi requirements to supplier expectations. Self-set targets face growing skepticism unless accompanied by detailed methodology and transparent progress reporting."

## Quick Comparison

- **Science-based targets (SBTi)**: Emissions reduction targets validated by the Science Based Targets initiative as consistent with limiting global warming to 1.5°C. Require Scope 1, 2, and material Scope 3 coverage. No offsets for target achievement. Independent validation against published criteria.
- **Self-set targets**: Company-defined emissions reduction targets without external scientific validation. Vary enormously in ambition, scope, methodology, offset reliance, and accountability. May or may not reference climate science.
- **Credibility**: SBTi targets carry third-party validation — investors, regulators, and stakeholders can trust the target meets scientific requirements. Self-set targets depend entirely on the company's transparency about methodology and assumptions.
- **Scope coverage**: SBTi requires Scope 1, 2, and Scope 3 if it represents 40%+ of total emissions. Self-set targets frequently exclude Scope 3 entirely or cover only selected categories.
- **Offset treatment**: SBTi prohibits offsets from counting toward near-term reduction targets. Self-set targets often rely significantly on purchased offsets to bridge the gap between actual reductions and stated goals.

## What are Science-Based Targets?

Science-based targets are corporate GHG emissions reduction targets that are independently validated as consistent with the level of decarbonization required to limit global warming to 1.5°C above pre-industrial levels, in line with the latest climate science and the Paris Agreement.

The Science Based Targets initiative, founded in 2015 by CDP, UN Global Compact, WRI, and WWF, developed the methodology and operates the validation service. Companies submit their targets — covering near-term (5-10 year) and optionally long-term (net zero by 2050) horizons — and SBTi assesses them against its published criteria.

The criteria are rigorous. Near-term targets must cover all Scope 1 and 2 emissions and Scope 3 if it exceeds 40% of total emissions. Targets must align with sector-specific or cross-sector 1.5°C pathways derived from IPCC carbon budgets. Absolute reductions are required — you can't purchase offsets to meet targets. The base year must be representative and no more than two years old at the time of submission.

Over 7,000 companies have committed to SBTi, with 4,000+ having validated targets. The initiative has become the recognized standard for corporate climate target credibility. CDP, the world's largest corporate environmental disclosure platform, explicitly rewards SBTi-validated targets in its scoring. Investor coalitions reference SBTi commitments. Procurement teams are building SBTi into supplier requirements.

## What are Self-Set Targets?

Self-set targets are any corporate emissions reduction targets defined by the company itself without external scientific validation. They range from thoughtful, science-informed goals developed with expert support to vague aspirational statements with no underlying methodology.

At their best, self-set targets are developed using credible methodologies, cover all material emission scopes, reference climate science for ambition-setting, and include transparent assumptions and progress tracking. Some companies develop targets that would likely pass SBTi validation but choose not to submit them — perhaps because they want flexibility to adjust methodology or because the validation timeline doesn't align with their announcement schedule.

At their worst, self-set targets are marketing exercises. Common problems include: cherry-picking favorable base years (setting the baseline in a high-emissions year to inflate percentage reductions), excluding Scope 3 to avoid the hardest-to-reduce emissions, counting purchased offsets as reductions, using intensity metrics that allow absolute emissions to rise, setting distant deadlines without interim milestones, and announcing targets without publishing reduction plans.

Research from the NewClimate Institute and Carbon Market Watch has repeatedly found that most corporate climate pledges — particularly self-set targets — lack the integrity needed to contribute meaningfully to global temperature goals. Their Corporate Climate Responsibility Monitor found that high-profile companies' targets frequently overstated their ambition.

## Key Differences

**External validation.** This is the fundamental differentiator. SBTi targets are reviewed by an independent body against published scientific criteria. Self-set targets are reviewed by nobody except the company itself (and possibly its consultants). Validation doesn't guarantee achievement, but it guarantees the target is calibrated to climate science.

**Methodological rigor.** SBTi specifies exactly how targets must be structured: absolute or intensity reductions, specific scope coverage requirements, alignment with 1.5°C pathways, defined base year rules. Self-set targets use whatever methodology the company chooses — or none at all. A "50% reduction by 2030" target means very different things depending on base year, scope, boundary, and whether offsets count.

**Scope 3 treatment.** SBTi requires Scope 3 in targets when it exceeds 40% of total emissions — which it does for most companies. Self-set targets frequently exclude Scope 3, which conveniently hides 70-90% of many companies' climate impact. This scope exclusion is the single biggest credibility gap in corporate climate commitments.

**Offset reliance.** SBTi explicitly prohibits offsets from counting toward near-term reduction targets. Only permanent carbon removal can neutralize the 5-10% residual emissions in the net zero long-term target. Self-set targets often rely heavily on cheap avoidance offsets, allowing companies to claim progress without changing operations.

**Accountability.** SBTi-committed companies must report progress annually through CDP or equivalent platforms. SBTi can revoke validation if targets are not maintained. Self-set targets have no external accountability mechanism — a company can quietly drop or revise its target without consequence.

**Ambition calibration.** SBTi targets are calibrated to global carbon budgets using sector-specific decarbonization pathways. A "50% reduction" might be ambitious for one sector and insufficient for another — SBTi accounts for this. Self-set targets often pick round numbers (50%, carbon neutral, net zero) without sector-specific scientific basis.

## When to Use Each

**Choose SBTi validation if**: you want maximum target credibility with investors, customers, and regulators. SBTi validation is the clearest signal that your climate commitment is real. It's particularly important if you're in a sector facing stakeholder scrutiny, if your customers require supplier climate targets, or if you want your CDP score to reflect validated ambition.

**Use self-set targets as a stepping stone if**: you're not yet ready for SBTi validation but want to signal climate commitment and begin reduction efforts. Set targets using SBTi-aligned methodology, be transparent about your approach, and commit to seeking validation within a defined timeline. The worst outcome is setting a vague self-set target and never progressing to validation.

**Avoid self-set targets as a permanent strategy if**: you have the operational capacity for SBTi validation. The credibility gap between validated and unvalidated targets is widening as SBTi adoption grows. Companies with self-set targets increasingly face the question: "If your target is credible, why haven't you submitted it for validation?"

## Council Fire's Perspective

We're blunt with clients: if you're setting a climate target in 2026 without SBTi validation, you need a compelling reason. The credibility premium from validated targets is significant and growing. Investors, procurement teams, and regulators increasingly treat SBTi validation as the minimum bar for a serious climate commitment.

That said, we also recognize that SBTi isn't perfect. The validation process takes time, the methodology evolves (sometimes creating uncertainty), and there are legitimate debates about specific methodological choices. But these are reasons to engage constructively with SBTi, not reasons to avoid validation altogether.

Our practical advice: build your emissions inventory to SBTi specifications even if you're not ready to submit targets tomorrow. The data infrastructure, scope coverage, and reduction pathway analysis required for SBTi validation are exactly what you need for effective climate management regardless. When you do submit, you're building on a solid operational foundation rather than scrambling to assemble data for a validation deadline.
