faqs:
  - question: "Is voluntary disclosure becoming obsolete?"
    answer: "No, but its role is changing. Voluntary frameworks like GRI, CDP, and TCFD laid the groundwork that mandatory regulations now build on. Going forward, voluntary disclosure fills gaps that regulation doesn't cover, allows companies to go beyond minimum requirements, and serves as a proving ground for future regulatory standards."
  - question: "Should I start with voluntary reporting even if regulation is coming?"
    answer: "Yes. Companies that built voluntary reporting programs are significantly better prepared for mandatory requirements. They've already developed data collection systems, internal expertise, and stakeholder engagement processes. Starting voluntarily also builds credibility — it shows commitment rather than mere compliance."
  - question: "Which voluntary frameworks align best with mandatory requirements?"
    answer: "GRI aligns closely with CSRD/ESRS. TCFD recommendations are embedded in ISSB standards, SEC climate rule, and UK disclosure requirements. CDP questionnaires increasingly map to regulatory requirements. SASB standards are now part of ISSB. If you pick the right voluntary frameworks, the transition to mandatory reporting is largely an evolution, not a revolution."
  - question: "Do investors prefer mandatory or voluntary disclosure?"
    answer: "Investors prefer comparable, reliable, assured data — which mandatory frameworks deliver more consistently. However, sophisticated investors also value voluntary disclosures that go beyond minimum requirements, particularly on strategy, targets, and forward-looking information that regulations may not mandate."

## Quick Comparison

- **Voluntary disclosure**: Company chooses to report ESG information using frameworks like GRI, CDP, TCFD, or proprietary sustainability reports. No legal obligation. Reporting scope, topics, and depth determined by the company.
- **Mandatory disclosure**: Legal or regulatory requirement to report specific ESG information in prescribed formats. Non-compliance carries penalties. Examples: CSRD, SEC climate rule, California SB 253/261, UK SDR.
- **Assurance**: Voluntary reports may or may not be assured. Mandatory frameworks increasingly require independent assurance (CSRD: limited assurance from day one).
- **Comparability**: Voluntary reports vary significantly in scope, methodology, and quality. Mandatory requirements standardize disclosure, enabling meaningful company-to-company comparison.
- **Enforcement**: Voluntary frameworks rely on reputation and market pressure. Mandatory requirements carry regulatory enforcement — fines, securities liability, market access restrictions.

## What is Voluntary ESG Disclosure?

Voluntary ESG disclosure encompasses any sustainability-related information a company chooses to publish without legal obligation. This includes sustainability reports following GRI Standards, CDP questionnaire responses, TCFD-aligned climate disclosures, integrated reports, and bespoke ESG publications.

The voluntary disclosure ecosystem developed because regulation lagged market demand. Investors wanted climate risk data that financial statements didn't provide. Consumers wanted supply chain transparency. Employees wanted to know their employer's social and environmental commitments. Companies responded by voluntarily disclosing information through frameworks that emerged to meet this demand.

GRI Standards, first published in 2000, became the most widely used voluntary sustainability reporting framework globally. CDP (formerly Carbon Disclosure Project) built the world's largest database of corporate environmental information through voluntary questionnaire responses. TCFD, established by the Financial Stability Board in 2015, created a voluntary framework for climate-related financial disclosures that's since been adopted by over 4,000 organizations.

The strength of voluntary disclosure is flexibility. Companies can focus on what's most relevant to their business and stakeholders, experiment with disclosure approaches, and go beyond what any regulation would require. The weakness is inconsistency — two companies in the same industry may produce sustainability reports so different in scope and methodology that comparison is meaningless.

## What is Mandatory ESG Disclosure?

Mandatory disclosure means a legal or regulatory authority requires companies meeting certain thresholds to report specific sustainability information in prescribed formats, subject to assurance requirements and enforcement mechanisms.

The CSRD is the most comprehensive mandatory ESG disclosure law, requiring approximately 50,000 companies to report against the full European Sustainability Reporting Standards starting from fiscal year 2024. The SEC's climate disclosure rule mandates climate-related disclosures for US public companies. California's SB 253 and SB 261 require climate disclosure from large companies operating in the state. Singapore, Japan, Australia, and Brazil are implementing or considering ISSB-aligned mandatory frameworks.

Mandatory disclosure shifts sustainability reporting from corporate communications to regulated reporting. The information goes into official filings (annual reports, business registers), is subject to assurance requirements, and carries legal consequences for misstatement or omission. This changes the game: legal teams get involved, internal controls become necessary, and the CFO's office takes ownership alongside the sustainability function.

The trend is decisively toward mandatory disclosure. The voluntary-to-mandatory pipeline is well established: TCFD recommendations became the basis for ISSB standards and SEC requirements. GRI concepts inform ESRS. CDP data collection methods influenced regulatory questionnaire design. What starts voluntary typically ends mandatory within 5-10 years.

## Key Differences

**Legal consequence.** Voluntary disclosure risks are reputational — poor reporting damages credibility. Mandatory disclosure risks are legal — incomplete or misleading reports trigger regulatory enforcement, fines, securities fraud claims, and potential market access restrictions. This changes how companies resource and govern their reporting.

**Comparability.** Mandatory standards prescribe what to disclose, how to measure it, and where to file it. This enables apples-to-apples comparison across companies, sectors, and jurisdictions. Voluntary reports — even those following the same framework — vary dramatically in scope, boundary-setting, and methodology, making comparison difficult.

**Assurance.** Mandatory frameworks increasingly require independent third-party assurance. CSRD mandates limited assurance immediately, progressing to reasonable assurance. The SEC requires attestation for emissions data. Most voluntary reports carry no assurance, and when they do, the scope is often limited. Assurance is the credibility multiplier that separates reliable disclosure from unverified claims.

**Scope and completeness.** Mandatory requirements specify minimum disclosure topics and data points. ESRS contains over 1,000 data points across 12 standards. Companies can't cherry-pick favorable metrics. Voluntary disclosure allows selective reporting — companies tend to highlight strong performance and omit areas of weakness. Research consistently shows that voluntary sustainability reports overrepresent positive information.

**Cost and complexity.** Mandatory compliance is expensive. CSRD implementation costs for large companies range from €500,000 to several million euros for systems, processes, assurance, and filing. Voluntary reporting can be done at any budget level, from a lean PDF produced by the sustainability team to a comprehensive GRI-aligned report with external assurance.

**Innovation space.** Voluntary disclosure allows companies to experiment with new metrics, reporting approaches, and stakeholder engagement methods. Mandatory standards are necessarily slower to evolve. The best reporting programs combine mandatory compliance as a floor with voluntary disclosure that goes further on topics material to their specific business and stakeholders.

## When to Use Each

**Voluntary disclosure makes sense if**: you're below mandatory reporting thresholds but want to build capability proactively, you want to go beyond minimum regulatory requirements on specific topics, or you're using frameworks like CDP or GRI that complement mandatory filings.

**Mandatory compliance is the priority if**: you meet the applicability thresholds for any mandatory framework. Non-compliance is not optional. Build your compliance program first, then layer voluntary disclosures on top for topics and stakeholders that regulations don't fully address.

**Both, strategically combined**: The most credible reporting programs meet mandatory requirements as the baseline and then use voluntary disclosure to address stakeholder interests that regulation doesn't cover, demonstrate leadership beyond compliance, and provide forward-looking strategy information that mandatory frameworks may not require.

## Council Fire's Perspective

We've watched the voluntary disclosure era yield valuable innovations while failing to deliver the consistency and reliability that markets need. Mandatory disclosure solves the comparability problem and forces laggards to report alongside leaders. That's a net positive for markets and stakeholders.

Our advice: treat upcoming mandatory requirements as the floor, not the ceiling. Companies that simply comply with minimum requirements miss an opportunity to differentiate. Use voluntary disclosure strategically to tell the story that mandatory filings can't — your long-term sustainability strategy, your stakeholder engagement approach, your innovation pipeline. The combination of a rock-solid mandatory filing plus a compelling voluntary sustainability narrative is what separates leaders from box-checkers.
