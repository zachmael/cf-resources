## What is DEI?

Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion (DEI) is an organizational framework for building workplaces where people of all backgrounds can thrive. Diversity refers to the representation of different identities—race, gender, ethnicity, age, disability, sexual orientation, socioeconomic background—within a workforce. Equity addresses systemic barriers that prevent equal access to opportunity, going beyond equality (treating everyone the same) to recognize that different people need different support to achieve similar outcomes. Inclusion is the cultural dimension: whether people feel valued, respected, and able to contribute fully regardless of their identity.

DEI as a formal corporate discipline gained significant momentum after the social justice movements of 2020, with companies collectively pledging over $200 billion toward racial equity initiatives. Chief Diversity Officer appointments surged, and DEI budgets expanded rapidly. However, the landscape has shifted considerably since then. By 2024-2025, some companies have scaled back DEI programs in response to political backlash, legal challenges to affirmative action (notably the U.S. Supreme Court's 2023 Students for Fair Admissions decision), and anti-DEI shareholder proposals.

Regardless of political headwinds, the business case for diverse teams remains well-documented. McKinsey's long-running "Diversity Wins" research series has consistently found that companies in the top quartile for ethnic and gender diversity outperform bottom-quartile peers on profitability. Diverse teams make better decisions, drive more innovation, and better reflect the customer bases they serve.

## What is the ESG Social Pillar?

The social pillar of ESG encompasses all human-related factors that affect a company's risk profile and long-term performance. This is broader than most people realize. The "S" in ESG covers labor practices and working conditions, human rights throughout the supply chain, health and safety performance, workforce diversity and inclusion, community relations, customer welfare, data privacy, and product safety.

ESG rating agencies assess the social pillar through a combination of quantitative metrics and qualitative evaluation. Sustainalytics examines social risk exposure and management practices. MSCI scores companies on human capital development, labor management, health and safety, and supply chain labor standards. S&P Global's Corporate Sustainability Assessment includes detailed social criteria within its methodology.

The social pillar has historically been considered the hardest to measure and the least developed of the three ESG dimensions. Environmental metrics benefit from physical science (tons of CO₂ are tons of CO₂). Governance has established indicators (board independence ratios, executive compensation structures). Social factors are more contextual, culturally variable, and harder to reduce to comparable numbers. But regulatory developments—particularly the CSRD's social disclosure requirements under ESRS S1-S4—are rapidly standardizing social reporting.

## Key Differences

**1. Scope of Concern.** DEI is specifically about who is in the room and whether they can thrive there. The ESG social pillar encompasses DEI but extends to the entire value chain—supply chain workers in Bangladesh, community health near manufacturing facilities, customer data protection, product safety for end users. DEI is one input to the social pillar, not the whole story.

**2. Internal vs. External Orientation.** DEI is predominantly inward-facing—focused on the company's own workforce, culture, and practices. The ESG social pillar requires outward assessment: How do your suppliers treat workers? What's your impact on local communities? Are your products safe for consumers? This external orientation connects social performance to material business risks that DEI alone doesn't address.

**3. Audience and Purpose.** DEI programs primarily serve employees (current and prospective) and respond to legal and cultural expectations. The ESG social pillar serves investors, regulators, and other external stakeholders who need to assess social risk as part of investment and compliance decisions. The audiences overlap but the primary purpose differs—talent strategy versus risk assessment.

**4. Measurement Paradigm.** DEI measurement is granular and demographic—percentage of women in leadership, racial composition by level, pay gap analyses, promotion velocity by identity group. ESG social measurement is broader and more aggregated—social risk scores, incident rates, policy coverage metrics. A company with excellent DEI metrics can still score poorly on the social pillar if it has supply chain labor violations or community opposition.

**5. Political Vulnerability.** DEI programs face direct political and legal challenge in ways that the broader ESG social pillar does not. Anti-DEI legislation, shareholder resolutions, and public discourse specifically target diversity initiatives. The ESG social pillar's broader framing—human capital management, health and safety, community relations—faces less targeted opposition, even as ESG overall encounters political backlash.

**6. Regulatory Framework.** DEI operates primarily under employment and civil rights law—Title VII, ADA, state-level equal opportunity statutes. The ESG social pillar is governed by sustainability disclosure regulations (CSRD, ISSB), supply chain due diligence laws (Germany's LkSG, the EU's CSDDD), and investor-facing requirements that exist in a separate legal domain.

## Which One Do You Need?

Every organization needs both, but for different reasons and through different governance mechanisms.

DEI is a talent and culture imperative. If you want to attract the best people, foster innovation, and reflect your customer base, you need a deliberate approach to diversity, equity, and inclusion. This doesn't require ESG infrastructure—it requires HR leadership, senior management commitment, data-driven target-setting, and cultural change management.

The ESG social pillar is a risk management and disclosure imperative. If you have investors, face regulatory disclosure requirements, or operate global supply chains, you need systematic assessment of social risks across your value chain. This requires ESG infrastructure—materiality assessments, data collection systems, reporting frameworks, and stakeholder engagement processes.

The smartest organizations integrate DEI into their ESG social strategy. Workforce diversity data feeds into ESG disclosures. Social pillar risk assessments identify DEI gaps that HR programs should address. The ESG framework provides structure and external accountability that strengthens DEI commitments beyond good intentions.

For companies navigating the current political environment: reframing DEI work within the broader ESG social pillar can provide strategic insulation. "Human capital management" and "workforce development" face less opposition than "DEI" while addressing many of the same underlying objectives.

## Council Fire's Perspective

The weaponization of DEI in political discourse is unfortunate, but it doesn't change the underlying business reality: companies that build diverse, equitable, and inclusive workplaces outperform those that don't. What it does change is framing and governance.

We advise clients to anchor DEI within their broader ESG social strategy—not to dilute it, but to strengthen it with the measurement rigor, governance infrastructure, and investor credibility that ESG frameworks provide. When DEI is a standalone HR initiative, it's vulnerable to budget cuts and political winds. When it's embedded in your material social risk management and tied to ESG disclosures that investors scrutinize, it becomes part of your corporate governance architecture. That's much harder to dismantle.

## Frequently Asked Questions

### Can a company have strong DEI but weak ESG social performance?
Yes. A company might have excellent workforce diversity and inclusion programs while simultaneously having poor supply chain labor practices, community opposition to its operations, or data privacy failures. DEI addresses one dimension of the social pillar. ESG social performance requires managing the full spectrum of social risks across the value chain. This is why integrated assessment matters—DEI success can mask social pillar weaknesses if they're evaluated in isolation.

### Are ESG rating agencies evaluating DEI specifically?
Most major agencies include workforce diversity metrics within their social assessments, but with varying weight and specificity. MSCI evaluates human capital development, which includes diversity indicators. S&P Global's CSA asks about workforce demographics, pay equity, and inclusion programs. However, DEI metrics are typically a subset of the broader social score, weighted alongside labor management, health and safety, and other factors. No major agency treats DEI as a standalone rating.

### How should companies report on DEI in the current political climate?
Focus on data, materiality, and business outcomes rather than ideological positioning. Report workforce demographics as factual data. Frame equity initiatives as human capital optimization. Connect inclusion to measurable business outcomes—retention, productivity, innovation metrics. This approach satisfies ESG disclosure requirements, demonstrates good management practice, and reduces political attack surface. The substance doesn't change; the framing becomes more durable.

### Does the CSRD require DEI reporting?
The CSRD, through the European Sustainability Reporting Standards (ESRS), requires disclosure on workforce characteristics including gender diversity at board and management levels, pay gap reporting, and policies related to equal treatment and opportunities. ESRS S1 (Own Workforce) includes specific metrics on diversity that overlap significantly with DEI reporting. Companies subject to CSRD will effectively need to report DEI data as part of their mandatory sustainability disclosures, regardless of domestic political attitudes toward DEI as a concept.
