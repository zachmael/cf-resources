## What is a Just Transition?

The just transition concept originated in the U.S. labor movement of the 1990s, championed by Tony Mazzocchi of the Oil, Chemical and Atomic Workers International Union. Mazzocchi argued that workers who had dedicated their careers to industries targeted for environmental regulation deserved support during the transition—not blame, not abandonment. His vision was a "Superfund for workers" that would provide income support and retraining for displaced employees.

The concept has since expanded well beyond its labor origins. The International Labour Organization (ILO) adopted just transition guidelines in 2015, defining it as "greening the economy in a way that is as fair and inclusive as possible to everyone concerned, creating decent work opportunities and leaving no one behind." The Paris Agreement explicitly references just transition in its preamble, acknowledging "the imperatives of a just transition of the workforce and the creation of decent work."

Today, just transition encompasses multiple dimensions: ensuring fossil fuel workers have pathways to new employment, supporting communities economically dependent on extractive industries, addressing the disproportionate climate burden on developing nations and marginalized populations, and guaranteeing that the benefits of clean energy—lower costs, cleaner air, new jobs—are distributed equitably rather than captured by wealthy nations and corporations.

## What is the Green Transition?

The green transition refers to the systemic shift from fossil fuel-based economies to low-carbon, resource-efficient systems. It encompasses the energy transition (coal to renewables), the mobility transition (combustion engines to EVs), the industrial transition (decarbonizing steel, cement, and chemicals), and the agricultural transition (reducing emissions from food production and land use).

This transition is already underway at scale. Global renewable energy capacity surpassed 3,800 GW in 2023. Electric vehicle sales exceeded 14 million units in the same year. The IEA projects that clean energy investment will reach $2 trillion annually by 2030. Entire industries are restructuring around decarbonization, driven by a combination of policy mandates (EU Green Deal, U.S. Inflation Reduction Act), technological cost reductions, and investor pressure.

The green transition is fundamentally an economic and technological transformation. It involves retiring existing fossil fuel infrastructure, deploying clean alternatives, building new supply chains (critical minerals, batteries, grid infrastructure), and restructuring labor markets. It's measured in gigawatts deployed, emissions reduced, investment mobilized, and fossil fuel assets retired.

## Key Differences

**1. Means vs. Manner.** The green transition describes what's changing—the technological and economic transformation. The just transition describes how it should change—equitably, inclusively, and with support for those most affected. One is the destination; the other is the route.

**2. Primary Constituency.** The green transition serves climate goals and, broadly, humanity's interest in a stable climate. The just transition serves specific populations: coal miners in Appalachia, oil workers in Alberta, frontline communities in the Global South, Indigenous peoples whose lands host both fossil fuel and renewable energy infrastructure.

**3. Speed vs. Equity Tension.** Climate science demands rapid decarbonization—the IPCC says global emissions must fall 43% by 2030 relative to 2019 levels. But speed can exacerbate injustice when plant closures happen faster than new economic opportunities emerge. The just transition framework insists that urgency doesn't excuse inequity. The green transition framework, in its purely technical form, is agnostic about distribution.

**4. Who Pays.** The green transition is increasingly market-driven—clean energy is often cheaper than fossil fuels on a levelized cost basis. But the just transition requires deliberate public investment that markets won't provide on their own: retraining programs, community economic diversification, pension guarantees, early retirement packages for displaced workers.

**5. Geographic Scale.** Green transition discussions often focus on national and global energy systems. Just transition concerns are intensely local—what happens to the town of 15,000 people when the coal plant closes? What happens to the single-industry region when extraction stops? This local specificity makes just transition policy harder to design and implement than macro energy policy.

**6. Institutional Ownership.** The green transition is driven by energy ministries, climate negotiators, technology companies, and investors. The just transition requires labor ministries, social welfare agencies, community development organizations, and affected workers themselves to have a seat at the table. Different institutions, different expertise, different power dynamics.

**7. Historical Responsibility.** Just transition frameworks explicitly address historical responsibility—the nations and corporations that profited most from fossil fuels bear greater obligation to fund the transition for those who didn't. Green transition frameworks sometimes acknowledge this through climate finance commitments but often focus on forward-looking technology deployment regardless of historical emissions.

## Which One Do You Need?

If you're shaping corporate climate strategy, you need to plan for both. Your decarbonization roadmap is your green transition—the technical pathway to reduce emissions across operations and value chain. Your just transition strategy addresses the human dimensions: what happens to workers in facilities you're closing? How are communities affected by your operational changes? Are the benefits of your clean energy investments reaching underserved populations?

For policymakers, the lesson of the past decade is that green transitions without just transition planning face political backlash. France's gilets jaunes protests erupted over a carbon tax perceived as unfairly burdening working people. Germany's coal phase-out required a €40 billion structural adjustment package for affected regions. Spain negotiated its coal mine closures with unions for years. Ignoring the "just" dimension doesn't just harm people—it stalls the "green" dimension.

For investors, just transition is an emerging risk factor. The Grantham Research Institute has documented how social opposition can delay or derail clean energy projects. The Climate Action 100+ investor initiative now includes just transition expectations in its corporate engagement framework. Understanding both dimensions is essential for assessing whether transition plans are credible and durable.

## Council Fire's Perspective

We see the just transition as the make-or-break factor for climate action. The world has the technology and capital to execute the green transition. What it lacks—in many places—is the social and political consensus to move at the required speed. That consensus can only be built when affected workers and communities see themselves as beneficiaries of the transition, not casualties.

For our clients, we emphasize that just transition isn't philanthropy—it's strategic risk management. Companies that close facilities without worker support face litigation, regulatory scrutiny, and brand damage. Companies that invest in community transition unlock social license, workforce loyalty, and the kind of political support that makes future decarbonization easier. The just transition isn't the soft side of climate strategy. It's the part that determines whether the hard side actually succeeds.

## Frequently Asked Questions

### Is the just transition only about fossil fuel workers?
No. While fossil fuel workers are the most visible constituency, just transition principles apply to anyone negatively affected by decarbonization. Autoworkers displaced by the shift to EVs (which require fewer labor hours to manufacture), agricultural workers affected by land-use changes, Indigenous communities impacted by critical mineral extraction for batteries, and consumers in developing nations facing energy cost increases are all within scope. The framework is about equity in transition, regardless of the specific industry.

### How are countries funding just transition programs?
Approaches vary widely. The EU established the Just Transition Fund with €17.5 billion for the 2021-2027 budget period, targeting regions most dependent on fossil fuels. South Africa secured $8.5 billion in Just Energy Transition Partnership (JETP) financing from wealthy nations at COP26. The U.S. Inflation Reduction Act directs significant clean energy investment toward "energy communities"—census tracts with closed coal mines or retired fossil fuel plants. At the corporate level, some companies establish transition funds for affected workers, often negotiated with unions.

### Can a company's green transition be "just" without a formal just transition plan?
It's unlikely. Without deliberate planning, the benefits of green investments tend to flow to shareholders and skilled workers in growth sectors, while costs fall on displaced workers and communities. A formal just transition plan—developed with affected stakeholder input—ensures that workforce impacts are anticipated, retraining is funded, community economic diversification is supported, and timelines allow for orderly adjustment. Hoping for the best isn't a strategy.

### How does just transition relate to ESG reporting?
Just transition is increasingly embedded in ESG frameworks. The ISSB's climate disclosure standards reference workforce impacts of transition plans. The EU Taxonomy requires companies to demonstrate that taxonomy-aligned activities don't cause significant harm to social objectives, including labor rights. ESG rating agencies are beginning to evaluate just transition policies as part of the social pillar. For companies reporting under CSRD, the European Sustainability Reporting Standards (ESRS) include specific disclosure requirements related to affected communities and workers in transition.
