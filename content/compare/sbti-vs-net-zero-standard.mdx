faqs:
  - question: "Is SBTi the only credible net zero standard?"
    answer: "It's the most widely recognized corporate standard with independent validation. The ISO Net Zero Guidelines (IWA 42:2022) and the UN High-Level Expert Group recommendations are credible frameworks but lack SBTi's company-level validation process. For corporate target-setting, SBTi remains the gold standard."
  - question: "How long does SBTi validation take?"
    answer: "Expect 6-12 months from commitment letter to validated targets. The process involves submitting targets, SBTi review against criteria, potential revision requests, and final validation. Complex Scope 3 inventories or FLAG (Forest, Land, and Agriculture) targets can extend timelines."
  - question: "Can I use carbon offsets to meet SBTi targets?"
    answer: "Not for near-term targets. SBTi requires actual emissions reductions within your value chain. Offsets can supplement but not replace reductions. For the net zero target, SBTi allows neutralization of residual emissions (5-10% of baseline) through permanent carbon removals — not avoidance offsets."
  - question: "What if my sector doesn't have an SBTi pathway?"
    answer: "SBTi has sector-specific pathways for power, cement, steel, aviation, chemicals, and others. If your sector lacks a specific pathway, the cross-sector absolute contraction or sectoral decarbonization approach applies. FLAG guidance covers agriculture and forestry."

## Quick Comparison

- **SBTi Corporate Net Zero Standard**: Independently validated, requires 90-95% absolute emissions reductions by 2050 across Scopes 1-3, with near-term targets (5-10 years) aligned to 1.5°C. Residual emissions neutralized through permanent carbon removal.
- **ISO Net Zero Guidelines (IWA 42)**: Voluntary framework providing principles and guidance for net zero claims. No validation process. Covers organizations, cities, and regions. Less prescriptive than SBTi.
- **UN Race to Zero / High-Level Expert Group**: Campaign-level commitments with integrity criteria. Requires participants to set targets through recognized standards (often SBTi). Adds accountability layer but doesn't itself validate targets.
- **Self-set net zero targets**: Company-defined targets without external validation. Vary enormously in ambition, scope coverage, offset reliance, and timeline. No standardized methodology or accountability mechanism.

## What is the SBTi Net Zero Standard?

The Science Based Targets initiative — a partnership between CDP, UN Global Compact, WRI, and WWF — launched its Corporate Net Zero Standard in October 2021. It defines what a credible corporate net zero commitment looks like and provides a validation service to verify that company targets meet the standard's requirements.

The standard has two components. Near-term targets require companies to reduce Scope 1, 2, and 3 emissions in line with 1.5°C pathways over a 5-10 year horizon. These are absolute reduction targets — you can't buy your way out with offsets. Long-term targets require companies to reduce emissions by at least 90% (or 95% for some sectors) from a base year by no later than 2050.

What happens with the remaining 5-10%? SBTi requires companies to neutralize residual emissions through permanent carbon dioxide removal — think direct air capture or biochar with verified permanence, not avoided deforestation credits. This is a deliberate distinction: SBTi treats removal of your last unavoidable tons differently from the deep cuts required to get there.

As of early 2026, over 7,000 companies have committed to SBTi, with over 4,000 having validated targets. The initiative has become the de facto standard for corporate climate target credibility, referenced by investors, regulators, and procurement teams globally.

## What are Other Net Zero Approaches?

Several alternatives exist for companies setting net zero targets outside SBTi:

**ISO Net Zero Guidelines (IWA 42:2022)** provide consensus-based principles for net zero pledges by organizations, cities, and regions. They're more flexible than SBTi — covering a broader range of entities — but less prescriptive. There's no validation service. A company can claim alignment with ISO net zero guidelines without anyone checking.

**The UN Race to Zero** campaign requires participants to pledge, plan, proceed, and publish on net zero. Participation requires using a recognized partner standard (SBTi, Carbon Trust, or others) for target-setting. It adds a campaign framework and peer accountability but isn't a standard itself.

**Voluntary carbon neutrality claims** under PAS 2060 or self-defined frameworks allow companies to declare "net zero" or "carbon neutral" by combining some reductions with offsets for the remainder. These approaches face increasing scrutiny — the EU Green Claims Directive will restrict unsubstantiated carbon neutrality claims, and the UK's Advertising Standards Authority has already cracked down on misleading net zero advertising.

**Completely self-set targets** remain common. A company announces it will be "net zero by 2040" without specifying scope coverage, offset usage, base year, or methodology. These targets are essentially marketing statements until backed by detailed plans and external validation.

## Key Differences

**Validation and accountability.** SBTi is the only major approach offering independent third-party validation of corporate net zero targets against defined scientific criteria. ISO provides guidelines without validation. Self-set targets have no external accountability mechanism. This validation gap is the single biggest differentiator.

**Offset treatment.** SBTi strictly limits offsets — they cannot count toward near-term reduction targets, and only permanent carbon removal qualifies for neutralizing residual emissions in the long-term target. Other approaches vary dramatically: some allow unlimited offsets, some encourage but don't require limits, and self-set targets often rely heavily on cheap avoidance credits.

**Scope coverage.** SBTi requires Scope 1, 2, and material Scope 3 categories in both near-term and long-term targets. Many self-set targets conveniently exclude Scope 3, which typically represents the majority of a company's emissions footprint. This scope cherry-picking is one of the most common credibility problems in corporate net zero claims.

**Scientific basis.** SBTi targets are calibrated against carbon budgets consistent with limiting warming to 1.5°C, using sectoral decarbonization or absolute contraction approaches grounded in IPCC scenarios. Self-set targets may or may not have any relationship to climate science — a company targeting "50% reduction by 2040" may sound ambitious but could be entirely insufficient for its sector.

**Ambition level.** The 90-95% reduction requirement before neutralization makes SBTi among the most demanding standards. Approaches that allow 50-70% reductions plus offsets for the remainder set a fundamentally lower bar, even if they label the outcome "net zero."

## When to Use Each

**Choose SBTi if**: you want maximum credibility with investors, regulators, and enterprise buyers. SBTi validation is increasingly a procurement requirement for large companies and a positive signal in ESG ratings. If you're serious about decarbonization and want external validation to prove it, SBTi is the standard.

**Use ISO guidelines if**: you're a city, region, or organization type not covered by SBTi's corporate standard. ISO net zero guidelines provide a structured framework where SBTi doesn't operate.

**Join Race to Zero if**: you want campaign-level visibility and peer accountability alongside your SBTi targets. The two are complementary — Race to Zero endorses SBTi as a recognized partner standard.

**Avoid self-set targets without validation if**: you care about credibility. The window for vague corporate net zero claims is closing rapidly. Regulators, investors, and consumers increasingly distinguish between validated and unvalidated targets.

## Council Fire's Perspective

We recommend SBTi for any company with the operational capacity to pursue validation. The rigor of the process forces companies to confront their actual emissions profile — including the Scope 3 categories they'd prefer to ignore — and build reduction pathways grounded in science rather than aspiration.

The companies we've seen get the most value from SBTi aren't just checking a box. They use the target-setting process to identify efficiency opportunities, engage suppliers on emissions reduction, and build internal alignment around a decarbonization roadmap with teeth. The target becomes a management tool, not just a communications asset.

For companies not yet ready for SBTi validation, we still recommend using SBTi criteria as internal benchmarks. Set your targets as if you were going to submit them. When you're ready for external validation, you'll already be most of the way there.
