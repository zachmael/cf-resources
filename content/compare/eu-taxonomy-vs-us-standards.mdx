faqs:
  - question: "Does the US have an equivalent to the EU Taxonomy?"
    answer: "No. The US has no federal classification system defining which economic activities qualify as environmentally sustainable. The closest equivalents are sector-specific regulations (EPA standards, SEC climate disclosure), voluntary frameworks (SASB, GRI), and state-level initiatives like California's climate disclosure laws. The fragmented US approach contrasts sharply with the EU's unified taxonomy."
  - question: "Do US companies need to comply with the EU Taxonomy?"
    answer: "If your company has EU operations, is listed on EU-regulated markets, or falls under CSRD reporting thresholds, you may need to report taxonomy alignment for your EU-relevant activities. The taxonomy doesn't apply to purely domestic US operations, but multinational companies increasingly face dual compliance requirements."
  - question: "Which approach is better for driving green investment?"
    answer: "The EU Taxonomy provides clear, science-based criteria that remove ambiguity about what counts as green — making it easier for investors to identify aligned assets. The US market-driven approach offers more flexibility but creates greenwashing risk because there's no authoritative definition of sustainable. Both approaches have trade-offs: the EU system can be rigid and compliance-heavy; the US system is more adaptable but less standardized."
  - question: "How does this affect green bond issuance?"
    answer: "The EU Green Bond Standard (launching 2025) requires alignment with the EU Taxonomy. In the US, green bonds follow voluntary principles (ICMA Green Bond Principles) with no mandatory taxonomy alignment. EU-aligned bonds provide investors with stronger assurance about use of proceeds, while US green bonds offer more flexibility in defining eligible projects."

## Quick Comparison

- **Structure**: The EU Taxonomy is a single, legally mandated classification system. The US relies on a patchwork of federal regulations, state laws, voluntary frameworks, and market standards.
- **Definition of "green"**: The EU Taxonomy sets specific technical screening criteria for each economic activity. The US has no unified definition — "sustainable" means different things under different frameworks.
- **Legal status**: EU Taxonomy is binding for in-scope companies (large EU companies, financial market participants). US standards are mostly voluntary, with limited mandatory disclosure (SEC, California SB 253/SB 261).
- **Scope**: EU Taxonomy covers six environmental objectives — climate mitigation, adaptation, water, circular economy, pollution, biodiversity. US standards vary by framework, with most focusing primarily on climate.
- **Do No Significant Harm**: EU Taxonomy requires activities to meet technical criteria AND not significantly harm other environmental objectives. US frameworks generally don't include cross-objective harm tests.

## What is the EU Taxonomy?

The EU Taxonomy Regulation (2020/852) establishes a classification system that defines which economic activities are environmentally sustainable. It's not a reporting standard — it's a dictionary. It answers the question: "What counts as green?"

For an activity to be taxonomy-aligned, it must make a substantial contribution to at least one of six environmental objectives, do no significant harm (DNSH) to the other five, and meet minimum social safeguards (aligned with OECD Guidelines and UN Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights).

The technical screening criteria are granular and science-based. For climate mitigation, electricity generation must emit less than 100g CO₂e/kWh to qualify. Building renovation must achieve a 30% reduction in primary energy demand. These aren't vague aspirations — they're measurable thresholds grounded in climate science and the EU's 2050 net-zero pathway.

Companies in scope (those subject to CSRD) must report what percentage of their revenue, capital expenditure, and operating expenditure is taxonomy-aligned. Financial institutions must report taxonomy alignment of their portfolios. This creates a standardized, comparable metric for greenness that feeds directly into investment decisions.

The taxonomy has been politically contentious. The inclusion of natural gas and nuclear energy as transitional activities drew criticism from environmental groups. But the core architecture — specific, measurable criteria tied to scientific thresholds — remains the most detailed attempt by any jurisdiction to define sustainable economic activity.

## What are US Sustainability Standards?

The US approach to sustainable finance and ESG disclosure is decentralized, market-driven, and evolving. There is no single federal taxonomy or classification system. Instead, companies and investors work with a combination of:

**Federal regulations**: The SEC's climate disclosure rule (adopted 2024, partially stayed) requires public companies to disclose climate-related risks, governance, and Scope 1/2 emissions. It's narrower than CSRD and doesn't include a taxonomy component.

**State laws**: California's SB 253 (Climate Corporate Data Accountability Act) and SB 261 (Climate-Related Financial Risk Act) require large companies operating in California to report GHG emissions and climate financial risks. Other states have their own requirements.

**Voluntary frameworks**: SASB (now part of ISSB/IFRS Foundation), GRI, CDP, and the GHG Protocol provide reporting standards widely used by US companies. These are voluntary but increasingly expected by investors.

**Market standards**: The ICMA Green Bond Principles, Climate Bonds Initiative taxonomy, and various ESG rating methodologies create de facto market standards without legal mandate.

This fragmented approach reflects US regulatory philosophy — markets drive standards, government sets guardrails. The result is flexibility and innovation, but also inconsistency, comparability challenges, and greenwashing vulnerability.

## Key Differences

- **Prescriptiveness**: The EU Taxonomy tells you exactly what qualifies as sustainable with quantitative thresholds. US standards let companies and investors define sustainability based on chosen frameworks and market expectations.
- **Comparability**: EU Taxonomy alignment is directly comparable across companies — 45% taxonomy-aligned revenue means the same thing for every company. US disclosures vary by framework, methodology, and scope, making apples-to-apples comparison difficult.
- **Political dynamics**: The EU has bipartisan (cross-party) support for green finance architecture. In the US, ESG has become politically polarized, with some states passing anti-ESG legislation restricting consideration of ESG factors in public pension investments.
- **Enforcement**: EU Taxonomy reporting is legally mandated with audit requirements. Most US sustainability disclosure is voluntary, with enforcement limited to anti-fraud provisions and emerging state mandates.
- **Transition recognition**: The EU Taxonomy includes transitional and enabling activities — acknowledging that some activities aren't yet green but are essential for the transition. US frameworks generally don't formalize this distinction.
- **Financial product labeling**: EU regulations (SFDR) require financial products to disclose taxonomy alignment. US fund labeling for ESG is guided by SEC rules on naming conventions but lacks taxonomy-linked requirements.

## When to Use Each

**Focus on EU Taxonomy when:**
- Your company operates in the EU or is listed on EU-regulated markets
- You're subject to CSRD reporting requirements
- You're issuing green bonds under the EU Green Bond Standard
- You're marketing financial products to EU investors under SFDR
- You want the most rigorous, science-based classification of your green activities

**Work within US standards when:**
- Your operations and investors are primarily US-based
- You're responding to SEC disclosure requirements or California climate laws
- Your industry peers use SASB, GRI, or CDP as primary frameworks
- You need flexibility to define materiality based on your specific business context
- You're engaging with US ESG rating agencies (MSCI, Sustainalytics, S&P Global)

**Address both when:**
- You're a multinational with operations and investors in both jurisdictions
- You're issuing securities in both EU and US markets
- Your supply chain spans both regions and you face compliance requirements on both sides

## Council Fire's Recommendation

If you're a multinational, build your sustainability data infrastructure to satisfy EU Taxonomy requirements first. The EU system is more demanding, more specific, and more data-intensive. If you can report taxonomy alignment accurately, producing US-compliant disclosures becomes straightforward — you already have the underlying data.

For US-only companies, don't ignore the EU Taxonomy even if you're not directly in scope. The taxonomy's technical screening criteria are becoming a global reference point for what counts as green. Banks, investors, and supply chain partners increasingly use taxonomy-like criteria to evaluate counterparties worldwide.

The political polarization around ESG in the US is a real consideration but shouldn't drive long-term strategy. Disclosure requirements are tightening globally, and companies that build robust data systems now will be better positioned regardless of which direction US policy takes.

Council Fire helps companies map their activities against EU Taxonomy criteria, identify alignment gaps, and build reporting systems that satisfy both EU and US requirements from a single data foundation.
