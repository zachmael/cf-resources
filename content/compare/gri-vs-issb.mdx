faqs:
  - question: "Are GRI and ISSB competing with each other?"
    answer: "They occupy different lanes. GRI focuses on a company's impact on people and the environment (impact materiality). ISSB focuses on how sustainability topics affect a company's financial performance (financial materiality). Since 2022, GRI and IFRS Foundation have published interoperability guidance recognizing that companies will often use both."
  - question: "Which framework do regulators prefer?"
    answer: "It depends on jurisdiction. The EU's CSRD mandates ESRS, which is built on GRI foundations and uses double materiality (both impact and financial). Jurisdictions adopting ISSB standards — including the UK, Canada, Australia, Japan, and others — are embedding IFRS S1/S2 into their disclosure rules. Many companies will face both."
  - question: "Can I use GRI data to satisfy ISSB requirements?"
    answer: "Partially. There's meaningful overlap in environmental metrics (emissions, energy, water) and governance disclosures. But ISSB requires specific financial impact analysis, scenario analysis for climate risks, and integration with financial statements that GRI doesn't demand. GRI data is a strong starting point, but ISSB requires additional financial framing."
  - question: "Which should a midsize company start with?"
    answer: "If you're in the EU or expect CSRD to apply, start with GRI-aligned reporting since ESRS builds on it. If you're listed in a jurisdiction adopting ISSB, start there. If neither applies yet, GRI gives you broader coverage of sustainability topics and serves the widest range of stakeholders. Layer on ISSB-specific requirements as they become relevant."

## Quick Comparison

- **Publisher**: GRI is maintained by the Global Reporting Initiative, an independent international organization founded in 1997. ISSB standards (IFRS S1 and S2) are published by the International Sustainability Standards Board under the IFRS Foundation.
- **Materiality**: GRI uses impact materiality — report on your most significant impacts on economy, environment, and people. ISSB uses financial materiality — report on sustainability matters that could reasonably affect enterprise value.
- **Scope of topics**: GRI covers all sustainability topics (environmental, social, economic, governance) with 30+ topic standards. ISSB currently covers general sustainability disclosures (S1) and climate (S2), with additional topic standards in development.
- **Primary audience**: GRI serves all stakeholders — communities, employees, regulators, civil society, investors. ISSB serves primarily investors and capital markets.
- **Regulatory adoption**: GRI underpins the EU's ESRS standards (mandatory under CSRD). ISSB is being adopted or referenced by 20+ jurisdictions for capital markets disclosure.

## What are GRI Standards?

GRI Standards are the world's most widely used sustainability reporting framework. Over 10,000 organizations across 100+ countries report using GRI, making it the de facto global standard for impact-focused sustainability disclosure.

GRI's architecture has three tiers. Universal Standards (GRI 1, 2, 3) apply to every reporting organization — they set reporting principles, require organizational-level disclosures, and define the materiality assessment process. Topic Standards (GRI 200-400 series) cover specific subjects like emissions (GRI 305), water (GRI 303), labor practices (GRI 401-407), human rights (GRI 408-414), and anti-corruption (GRI 205). Sector Standards provide guidance on likely material topics for specific industries.

The materiality process is central to GRI. Organizations identify their most significant impacts through stakeholder engagement, prioritize them, and then report using the relevant topic standards. This means GRI reports are tailored — a mining company and a software company will report on different topics based on their respective impacts.

GRI's strength is breadth and stakeholder inclusivity. It captures impacts that financial materiality frameworks miss — a company's effect on local water systems, community health, labor rights in supply chains, or biodiversity loss. These impacts matter to regulators, communities, and employees even when they don't show up in quarterly earnings.

The EU's decision to build ESRS on GRI foundations cemented GRI's regulatory relevance. While ESRS isn't identical to GRI (it adds financial materiality for double materiality and has different structure), the conceptual alignment means companies already reporting under GRI have a significant head start on CSRD compliance.

## What are ISSB Standards?

The International Sustainability Standards Board published IFRS S1 (General Requirements for Disclosure of Sustainability-related Financial Information) and IFRS S2 (Climate-related Disclosures) in June 2023. These standards create a global baseline for investor-focused sustainability disclosure.

ISSB was created to bring the same rigor and global consistency to sustainability reporting that IFRS accounting standards brought to financial reporting. The IFRS Foundation consolidated several existing initiatives — absorbing the Value Reporting Foundation (which housed SASB and Integrated Reporting) and building on TCFD recommendations — to create ISSB.

IFRS S1 requires companies to disclose material sustainability-related risks and opportunities across governance, strategy, risk management, and metrics/targets. It draws heavily on the TCFD four-pillar structure. IFRS S2 provides specific climate disclosure requirements including Scope 1, 2, and 3 greenhouse gas emissions, climate-related scenario analysis, and transition plan disclosure.

ISSB's financial materiality lens means companies report sustainability information that could influence investor decisions about enterprise value. This doesn't mean environmental or social topics are excluded — it means they're included when they affect financial performance, position, or prospects. A company facing water scarcity that threatens production reports it because it's a financial risk, not because of the environmental impact per se.

Adoption is accelerating. The UK, Canada, Australia, Nigeria, Japan, Singapore, Brazil, and others have announced plans to adopt or reference ISSB standards. The standards are designed to be jurisdiction-agnostic, allowing national regulators to adopt them with local modifications.

## Key Differences

- **The materiality divide**: This is the core distinction. GRI asks "what are your biggest impacts on the world?" ISSB asks "what sustainability issues most affect your financial value?" A chemical company's toxic waste disposal is material under GRI because of environmental harm. Under ISSB, it's material if cleanup costs, litigation, or regulatory penalties affect financial performance.
- **Topic coverage**: GRI covers the full ESG spectrum today. ISSB currently covers climate in depth (S2) and general sustainability broadly (S1), with sector-specific and topical standards still being developed. ISSB will eventually cover biodiversity, human capital, and other topics, but GRI has a 25-year head start on breadth.
- **Connection to financial statements**: ISSB standards are designed to sit alongside IFRS financial statements, with explicit requirements for connectivity between sustainability and financial disclosures. GRI operates independently of financial reporting — sustainability reports are standalone documents.
- **Assurance trajectory**: Both frameworks expect external assurance, but ISSB's integration with financial reporting positions it for audit-firm assurance aligned with financial statement audit processes. GRI assurance has historically been performed by both audit firms and specialized sustainability assurance providers.
- **Flexibility**: GRI gives organizations discretion in determining material topics through stakeholder engagement. ISSB, augmented by SASB industry standards, provides more prescribed disclosure topics for each industry, reducing variability but also reducing the ability to tailor.
- **Double materiality**: GRI provides the impact materiality side. ISSB provides the financial materiality side. CSRD requires both (double materiality). Companies subject to CSRD effectively need the perspectives of both frameworks.

## When to Use Each

**Use GRI when:**
- You're reporting to diverse stakeholders beyond investors
- CSRD/ESRS applies or will apply to your organization
- Your material impacts include social, community, and human rights topics not yet covered by ISSB
- You want a well-established framework with extensive guidance and sector coverage
- Your sustainability report is a standalone publication for multiple audiences

**Use ISSB when:**
- Your primary reporting obligation is investor-focused capital markets disclosure
- Your jurisdiction is adopting IFRS S1/S2 into national regulation
- You need sustainability data integrated with financial statements
- SASB industry metrics already align with your reporting practices
- You want to satisfy TCFD-aligned disclosure with an updated, standardized framework

**Use both when:**
- You're subject to CSRD (which requires double materiality, drawing on both perspectives)
- You're a multinational listed in multiple jurisdictions with different requirements
- You want to serve both investor and broader stakeholder audiences credibly
- Your reporting maturity supports dual-framework alignment

## Council Fire's Recommendation

Stop thinking about GRI and ISSB as an either/or decision. The global reporting architecture is converging on double materiality, which means you need both the impact perspective (GRI's strength) and the financial perspective (ISSB's strength). Companies subject to CSRD already face this reality. Others will follow.

Build your data infrastructure to support both. The overlap in underlying data — emissions, energy, water, workforce, governance — is substantial. The differentiation is in framing and analysis: GRI requires impact assessment and stakeholder engagement; ISSB requires financial impact analysis and scenario modeling. Same data, different analytical layers.

Council Fire helps companies design reporting architectures that serve GRI, ISSB, and ESRS requirements from a unified data platform — reducing duplication, ensuring consistency, and positioning you for whichever regulatory requirements arrive next.
