faqs:
  - question: "Do I need both ISO 14001 and ISO 14064?"
    answer: "It depends on your goals. ISO 14001 gives you a management system for all environmental aspects — waste, water, air quality, energy, land use, and more. ISO 14064 gives you a rigorous GHG accounting and verification standard. If climate is your primary focus, ISO 14064 may suffice. If you need a broader environmental management framework with GHG accounting integrated, use both."
  - question: "Can ISO 14001 cover greenhouse gas management?"
    answer: "Yes, but not with the same rigor as ISO 14064. ISO 14001 requires organizations to identify significant environmental aspects — which can include GHG emissions — and manage them through the EMS. But it doesn't prescribe GHG quantification methodology, reporting boundaries, or verification requirements the way ISO 14064 does."
  - question: "Which is harder to implement?"
    answer: "ISO 14001 is more operationally demanding because it touches every environmental aspect of your organization and requires systemic changes to processes, training, documentation, and internal audit. ISO 14064 is more technically demanding — it requires robust GHG data collection, calculation methodologies, uncertainty assessment, and third-party verification. Different kinds of difficulty."
  - question: "Are these certifications recognized globally?"
    answer: "Yes. Both are published by the International Organization for Standardization and recognized worldwide. ISO 14001 certification is issued by accredited certification bodies after third-party audit. ISO 14064 verification is performed by accredited verification bodies. Both carry credibility across jurisdictions, supply chains, and regulatory contexts."

## Quick Comparison

- **Purpose**: ISO 14001 establishes requirements for an environmental management system (EMS). ISO 14064 provides specifications for quantifying, monitoring, reporting, and verifying greenhouse gas emissions and removals.
- **Scope**: ISO 14001 covers all environmental aspects — emissions, waste, water, energy, biodiversity, chemicals, noise, land use. ISO 14064 focuses exclusively on greenhouse gases.
- **Structure**: ISO 14001 follows the Plan-Do-Check-Act management system cycle. ISO 14064 is structured in three parts: Part 1 (organization-level GHG inventory), Part 2 (project-level GHG reductions), Part 3 (verification and validation).
- **Certification**: ISO 14001 offers formal certification through accredited certification bodies. ISO 14064 provides for third-party verification of GHG statements (not certification of the organization itself).
- **Who uses it**: ISO 14001 is used by organizations seeking to systematize environmental management across operations. ISO 14064 is used by organizations needing credible GHG accounting for reporting, trading, regulatory compliance, or voluntary disclosure.

## What is ISO 14001?

ISO 14001 is the international standard for environmental management systems. First published in 1996 and most recently revised in 2015, it provides a framework for organizations to manage their environmental responsibilities systematically, improve environmental performance, and meet compliance obligations.

The standard doesn't set specific environmental performance levels. It doesn't tell you how much to reduce emissions or what waste targets to hit. Instead, it requires a management system — a structured approach to identifying environmental aspects, setting objectives, implementing controls, monitoring performance, and driving continual improvement.

ISO 14001 follows the Plan-Do-Check-Act cycle. In the planning phase, organizations identify environmental aspects and impacts, determine legal requirements, and set environmental objectives. Implementation involves establishing operational controls, training staff, preparing for emergencies, and communicating environmental management practices. Checking requires monitoring, measurement, internal audit, and management review. Acting means taking corrective actions and driving improvement based on findings.

Over 500,000 ISO 14001 certificates have been issued worldwide, making it the most widely adopted environmental management standard. It's used across every sector — manufacturing, services, construction, healthcare, government. Many large organizations require ISO 14001 certification from suppliers as a condition of doing business.

The standard's strength is systemic thinking. Rather than addressing environmental issues piecemeal, ISO 14001 embeds environmental management into organizational governance, operational processes, and strategic planning. The weakness is that certification demonstrates system existence, not environmental outcomes — a certified company may still have significant environmental impact if its objectives are unambitious.

## What is ISO 14064?

ISO 14064 provides the international standard for greenhouse gas accounting and verification. Published in three parts, it covers the full cycle of GHG measurement, project accounting, and third-party verification.

**ISO 14064-1** (organization level) specifies principles and requirements for designing, developing, managing, and reporting organization-level GHG inventories. It covers direct emissions (Scope 1), energy indirect emissions (Scope 2), and other indirect emissions (Scope 3). The standard requires organizations to define boundaries, select quantification methodologies, assess uncertainty, and report results according to defined quality criteria.

**ISO 14064-2** (project level) provides principles and requirements for determining baselines, monitoring, quantifying, and reporting GHG emission reductions or removal enhancements from specific projects. This is used for carbon offset projects, clean energy installations, efficiency improvements, and other GHG reduction initiatives.

**ISO 14064-3** (verification and validation) specifies requirements for third-party verification of GHG assertions. Verification bodies use this standard to assess whether an organization's GHG statement or a project's claimed reductions are accurate, complete, and consistent with the stated methodology.

ISO 14064 aligns closely with the GHG Protocol — the two frameworks share concepts around organizational boundaries, emission scopes, and quantification approaches. ISO 14064 adds formal requirements for uncertainty assessment and provides the verification framework that the GHG Protocol itself doesn't include.

The standard is used by companies preparing for regulated carbon markets, organizations seeking credible voluntary disclosure, project developers registering carbon offset projects, and companies responding to supply chain GHG data requests. In jurisdictions with emissions trading schemes, ISO 14064-compliant inventories often form the basis for compliance reporting.

## Key Differences

- **Breadth vs. depth**: ISO 14001 is broad — it covers every environmental aspect an organization touches. ISO 14064 is deep — it covers one topic (GHG emissions) with rigorous quantification and verification requirements.
- **Management system vs. measurement standard**: ISO 14001 tells you how to manage environmental performance. ISO 14064 tells you how to measure and verify a specific environmental metric. One is about organizational processes; the other is about data quality.
- **Certification vs. verification**: ISO 14001 certification assesses whether your management system meets the standard's requirements. ISO 14064 verification assesses whether your GHG data is accurate and complete. Different assessments serving different purposes.
- **Continual improvement focus**: ISO 14001 explicitly requires continual improvement of environmental performance and the management system. ISO 14064 focuses on accuracy and completeness of measurement — improvement in actual GHG performance is a business decision, not a standard requirement.
- **Operational change**: ISO 14001 drives operational changes — new procedures, training programs, emergency preparedness, documentation systems, internal audits. ISO 14064 primarily drives data infrastructure changes — monitoring equipment, calculation tools, data management systems, uncertainty analysis.
- **Supply chain expectations**: Large buyers increasingly require ISO 14001 from suppliers as evidence of environmental management capability. ISO 14064 verification is increasingly expected for GHG data shared with customers, investors, and regulators — especially for Scope 3 accounting.

## When to Use Each

**Implement ISO 14001 when:**
- You need a structured framework for managing all environmental aspects, not just carbon
- Supply chain partners or customers require ISO 14001 certification
- You want to reduce environmental compliance risk through systematic management
- Your organization needs to build environmental management capability from scratch
- Regulatory requirements reference ISO 14001 as a recognized environmental management approach

**Implement ISO 14064 when:**
- You need a credible, verifiable GHG emissions inventory
- You're participating in carbon markets (compliance or voluntary)
- Investors, regulators, or customers require third-party verified emissions data
- You're developing carbon offset or reduction projects that need standardized accounting
- Your climate reporting needs to meet the rigor expected by frameworks like ISSB, CSRD, or CDP

**Implement both when:**
- You want systematic environmental management AND credible GHG accounting
- Your industry faces both broad environmental regulation and specific carbon reporting requirements
- You're building toward mature sustainability practices that cover environmental management, carbon strategy, and verified disclosure
- Supply chain requirements demand both management system certification and verified emissions data

## Council Fire's Recommendation

These standards work at different levels of the same problem. ISO 14001 gives you the organizational machinery to manage environmental performance systematically. ISO 14064 gives you the measurement precision to quantify and verify your carbon footprint. Most mature sustainability programs need both capabilities.

If you're starting from zero, begin with ISO 14064-1 to establish a credible GHG inventory — this feeds directly into CSRD, CDP, ISSB, and investor disclosure requirements. The demand for verified emissions data is growing faster than the demand for EMS certification. Then layer on ISO 14001 when you need systematic management of broader environmental aspects.

If you already have ISO 14001 certification, adding ISO 14064 is a natural extension — your EMS already captures environmental data and drives improvement processes. ISO 14064 sharpens your GHG accounting within that existing framework.

Council Fire helps companies implement both standards efficiently, building integrated environmental management and carbon accounting systems that satisfy multiple stakeholder requirements from a single data infrastructure.
