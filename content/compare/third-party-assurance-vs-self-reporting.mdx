## Quick Comparison

| | Third-Party Assurance | Self-Reporting |
|---|---|---|
| **Scope** | Independent verification of ESG data, claims, and disclosures by a qualified external party | Company-produced ESG reports and disclosures without external verification |
| **Applicability** | Increasingly required for regulated disclosures (CSRD, SEC); expected by investors | Universal—any company can self-report at any time |
| **Key Focus** | Data accuracy, completeness, and adherence to reporting standards | Communicating ESG performance, strategy, and commitments |
| **Credibility** | High—independent verification reduces greenwashing risk | Variable—depends on reporting quality, track record, and specificity |
| **Cost** | $50,000-$500,000+ depending on scope, company size, and assurance level | Internal staff time plus report design; no external verification fees |
| **Standards** | ISAE 3000/3410, AA1000AS, ISO 14064-3 | GRI, SASB, TCFD, ISSB, or bespoke frameworks |

## What is Third-Party Assurance?

Third-party assurance is the independent examination of a company's sustainability disclosures by a qualified external party—typically an accounting firm, specialized assurance provider, or certification body. The assurance provider evaluates whether the reported ESG data is accurate, complete, and prepared in accordance with stated reporting standards. The process mirrors financial auditing in structure, though the maturity and standardization of ESG assurance are still evolving.

Assurance comes in two levels. Limited assurance (also called review-level) involves analytical procedures and inquiries that provide a moderate level of confidence—the assurer concludes that "nothing has come to our attention" suggesting material misstatement. Reasonable assurance involves more extensive testing and verification, providing a high level of confidence—the assurer provides a positive opinion that the data is "fairly stated" in all material respects. Limited assurance is more common for sustainability data today, though reasonable assurance is the direction of regulatory travel.

The market for ESG assurance is growing rapidly. The EU's CSRD requires limited assurance on sustainability disclosures starting in 2024 (for reports published in 2025), with a transition to reasonable assurance planned. The SEC's climate disclosure proposals include phased assurance requirements. The ISSB standards assume that sustainability disclosures should be subject to assurance. The Big Four accounting firms (Deloitte, PwC, EY, KPMG) and specialized firms like Bureau Veritas, SGS, and DNV are the primary providers.

## What is Self-Reporting?

Self-reporting is the practice of companies producing and publishing ESG information without independent external verification. This includes standalone sustainability reports, ESG sections of annual reports, CDP questionnaire responses (which are self-reported, though CDP scores them), website disclosures, and investor presentations containing ESG data and claims.

Self-reporting is where most companies start their ESG disclosure journey. Using frameworks like GRI, SASB, or the TCFD recommendations, companies collect data, describe their management approach, set targets, and report progress. The quality ranges enormously—from sophisticated, data-rich reports prepared by dedicated sustainability teams to superficial glossy documents that prioritize photos over metrics.

The fundamental limitation of self-reporting is that the entity making the claims is also the entity verifying them. Companies choose what to disclose, how to frame it, and which data to highlight. There's no independent check on whether emissions calculations are accurate, whether stated policies are actually implemented, or whether reported metrics use consistent methodologies year over year. This doesn't mean self-reported data is necessarily wrong—but it means stakeholders must rely on the company's integrity and competence rather than independent verification.

## Key Differences

**1. Credibility and Trust.** Assured ESG data carries institutional credibility—an independent party has examined the data and found it reliable. Self-reported data depends entirely on the company's reputation and the specificity of its disclosures. In an era of heightened greenwashing scrutiny, the credibility gap between assured and unassured data is widening.

**2. Error Detection.** Assurance processes are designed to identify material errors, omissions, and inconsistencies in reported data. Assurers test calculations, verify source data against underlying records, assess methodological consistency, and evaluate whether disclosures conform to stated standards. Self-reporting relies on internal controls, which may be immature for sustainability data compared to financial data.

**3. Regulatory Trajectory.** Assurance is moving from voluntary to mandatory. The CSRD requires assurance on sustainability disclosures for over 50,000 EU companies. The SEC's climate proposals include assurance requirements for Scope 1 and 2 emissions. The ISSB framework assumes assurance-readiness. Companies that build assurance-ready data systems now will be ahead of requirements; those relying solely on self-reporting will face a compliance cliff.

**4. Cost and Resource Requirements.** Third-party assurance adds significant cost. Engagement fees range from $50,000 for a limited assurance on a focused scope to $500,000+ for reasonable assurance on comprehensive sustainability disclosures by a Big Four firm. Self-reporting costs are primarily internal—staff time for data collection, analysis, and report production—with optional expenditure on report design and publication.

**5. Data Infrastructure Requirements.** Assurance demands robust data systems with documented methodologies, clear audit trails, and consistent processes. Assurers need to trace reported numbers back to source records. Self-reporting can get by with less rigorous data infrastructure—spreadsheets, manual calculations, and narrative descriptions. The assurance readiness gap is one of the most significant challenges companies face in preparing for mandatory assurance.

**6. Scope Flexibility.** Self-reporting allows companies complete flexibility in choosing what to report and how to present it. Third-party assurance typically covers a defined scope agreed between the company and the assurer—specific metrics, specific reporting standards, specific time periods. This defined scope means assurance provides deep confidence on what it covers but doesn't validate everything in the report.

**7. Greenwashing Protection.** Assured data provides a legal and reputational shield against greenwashing accusations. If an independently verified number is later questioned, the company can point to the assurance process. Self-reported claims that turn out to be inaccurate or misleading expose the company to regulatory enforcement (FTC Green Guides, EU Green Claims Directive), investor lawsuits, and reputational damage with no independent verification to fall back on.

## Which One Do You Need?

If you're subject to the CSRD, the answer is straightforward: assurance is mandatory. Start building assurance-ready data systems now if you haven't already. Engage with assurance providers early—the market is capacity-constrained, and the Big Four and specialty firms are already booked up for early CSRD reporting cycles.

If you're not yet subject to mandatory assurance requirements, the decision depends on your stakeholder expectations and strategic goals. Companies raising capital, entering new markets, or facing investor scrutiny on ESG claims benefit significantly from voluntary assurance. The credibility premium of an assured sustainability report substantially exceeds the cost for companies where ESG performance is material to valuation.

For smaller companies or those early in their ESG journey, self-reporting using recognized frameworks (GRI, SASB) is a legitimate starting point. Focus on building data quality, methodology consistency, and process documentation that will eventually support assurance. Seeking limited assurance on your most material metrics—Scope 1 and 2 emissions, for example—provides credibility on key claims without the cost of full-scope assurance.

The most strategic approach is phased: start with self-reporting using recognized standards, add limited assurance on priority metrics, and progressively expand assurance scope toward reasonable assurance on comprehensive disclosures. This builds internal capability and external credibility incrementally.

## Council Fire's Perspective

The era of unverified ESG claims is ending. Between the CSRD's assurance mandate, the EU Green Claims Directive targeting greenwashing, investor demands for verified data, and growing litigation risk from misleading sustainability claims, self-reporting alone is becoming a liability rather than a communication strategy.

We help clients build "assurance-ready" sustainability data systems from day one—even before they engage an assurance provider. This means documented methodologies, clear data ownership, audit trails from source to report, and consistent processes that can withstand independent scrutiny. Companies that treat assurance readiness as a data infrastructure challenge rather than a reporting exercise find the eventual assurance engagement faster, cheaper, and less disruptive.

## Frequently Asked Questions

### What's the difference between limited and reasonable assurance?
Limited assurance (ISAE 3000) involves analytical procedures, inquiries, and limited testing to provide a moderate confidence level. The assurer's conclusion is framed negatively: "Nothing has come to our attention that causes us to believe the data is materially misstated." Reasonable assurance involves substantive testing, detailed evidence gathering, and verification procedures that provide a high confidence level. The conclusion is positive: "In our opinion, the data is fairly stated in all material respects." Reasonable assurance requires more work, costs more, and provides stronger credibility. The CSRD starts with limited and plans to transition to reasonable assurance.

### Who can provide ESG assurance?
Currently, both accounting firms and non-accounting assurance providers (Bureau Veritas, SGS, DNV, LRQA) perform ESG assurance. The CSRD allows EU member states to determine whether to restrict ESG assurance to statutory auditors or allow independent assurance providers. In practice, the Big Four accounting firms are expanding their ESG assurance practices rapidly, while specialist firms bring deep technical expertise in areas like emissions verification. The provider market is evolving, and regulatory decisions about who qualifies will shape competition.

### Does CDP disclosure count as assured data?
No. CDP responses are self-reported—companies complete questionnaires with their own data. CDP scores the quality and completeness of disclosures, but does not verify the underlying data. CDP does ask companies to indicate whether their emissions data has been externally verified, and companies that report verified data may receive higher scores. But a CDP score itself is not a substitute for third-party assurance on the underlying sustainability data.

### How should companies prepare for mandatory assurance?
Start with four steps: (1) Map your material ESG metrics and identify which will require assurance. (2) Document the methodology for calculating each metric—what data sources, what assumptions, what boundaries. (3) Build audit trails—ensure every reported number can be traced back to source records. (4) Test your systems by conducting an internal readiness assessment or engaging an assurance provider for a "dry run" limited assurance engagement before the mandatory deadline. Companies that invest in readiness 12-18 months before mandatory assurance find the process significantly smoother and less expensive.
