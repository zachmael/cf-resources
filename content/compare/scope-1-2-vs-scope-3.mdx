faqs:
  - question: "Why is Scope 3 so much larger than Scope 1 and 2?"
    answer: "Because Scope 3 captures the entire value chain — raw material extraction, supplier manufacturing, transportation, product use by customers, and end-of-life treatment. For most companies, especially those in sectors like retail, financial services, or technology, the vast majority of climate impact happens outside their direct operations."
  - question: "Do I legally need to report Scope 3?"
    answer: "It depends on jurisdiction. CSRD requires Scope 3 where material (with a phase-in period). California's SB 253 requires Scope 3 for companies with $1B+ revenue operating in California. The SEC final rule dropped Scope 3. SBTi requires Scope 3 in targets if it represents 40%+ of total emissions. The trend is clearly toward mandatory Scope 3 disclosure."
  - question: "How accurate does Scope 3 data need to be?"
    answer: "Start with spend-based estimates and improve over time. Regulators and frameworks expect reasonable estimates, not perfect data. The GHG Protocol allows screening estimates for initial assessments. What matters is identifying your material categories, establishing a baseline, tracking trends, and progressively improving data quality through supplier engagement."
  - question: "Which Scope 3 categories should I prioritize?"
    answer: "Run a screening assessment across all 15 categories first. For most companies, purchased goods and services (Category 1), use of sold products (Category 11), and upstream transportation (Category 4) dominate. But this varies dramatically by sector — a bank's Scope 3 is mostly financed emissions (Category 15), while a retailer's is purchased goods."

## Quick Comparison

- **Scope 1 (Direct emissions)**: GHG emissions from sources owned or controlled by the company — combustion in owned boilers, furnaces, vehicles; process emissions from manufacturing; fugitive emissions from refrigerants or gas leaks.
- **Scope 2 (Energy indirect)**: Emissions from purchased electricity, steam, heating, and cooling consumed by the company. Reported using market-based and/or location-based methods.
- **Scope 3 (Value chain)**: All other indirect emissions across 15 categories — purchased goods, business travel, employee commuting, upstream transportation, use of sold products, investments, end-of-life treatment, and more.
- **Typical proportion**: For most companies, Scope 1 and 2 combined represent 10-30% of total emissions. Scope 3 represents 70-90%.
- **Data quality**: Scope 1 and 2 use direct measurement or utility data (high accuracy). Scope 3 relies heavily on estimates, industry averages, and supplier-reported data (lower accuracy, improving over time).
- **Control**: Companies directly control Scope 1 and 2 through operational decisions. Scope 3 requires influencing suppliers, customers, and other value chain partners.

## What are Scope 1 and 2 Emissions?

The GHG Protocol Corporate Standard, published in 2001 and updated in 2004, established the three-scope framework that's now universal in corporate carbon accounting. Scopes 1 and 2 cover emissions within a company's operational boundary.

Scope 1 is straightforward: if your company burns natural gas in a boiler, runs diesel generators, operates a vehicle fleet, or uses refrigerants that leak, those emissions are Scope 1. You own the source, you measure the fuel or refrigerant, you calculate the emissions using standard factors. Data quality is generally high because companies already track fuel purchases and energy consumption for cost management.

Scope 2 covers the emissions generated at power plants to produce the electricity, steam, or heating/cooling your facilities consume. You don't burn the fuel — the utility does — but your demand drives those emissions. The GHG Protocol Scope 2 Guidance (2015) introduced two accounting methods: location-based (using grid-average emission factors) and market-based (reflecting specific procurement choices like renewable energy certificates or power purchase agreements).

Together, Scope 1 and 2 represent the emissions most directly tied to your operations. They're well-understood, relatively easy to measure, and within your direct control to reduce. This is why they were the first to be regulated and why they remain the baseline for any corporate emissions inventory.

## What are Scope 3 Emissions?

Scope 3 is everything else — the emissions embedded in your entire value chain that aren't captured in Scopes 1 or 2. The GHG Protocol Corporate Value Chain (Scope 3) Standard, published in 2011, defines 15 categories spanning upstream and downstream activities.

Upstream categories include purchased goods and services, capital goods, fuel and energy-related activities not included in Scope 1 or 2, upstream transportation and distribution, waste generated in operations, business travel, employee commuting, and upstream leased assets. Downstream categories include downstream transportation, processing of sold products, use of sold products, end-of-life treatment, downstream leased assets, franchises, and investments.

The scale is what catches companies off guard. An apparel company's Scope 3 from raw material cultivation, textile manufacturing, dyeing, shipping, and garment care by consumers dwarfs its store electricity and delivery fleet emissions. A bank's Scope 3 from financed emissions — the climate impact of companies it lends to and invests in — can be hundreds of times larger than its office energy use. A software company's Scope 3 from cloud infrastructure, employee commuting, and hardware supply chains often exceeds Scope 1 and 2 by a factor of 10 or more.

Measuring Scope 3 is genuinely hard. You're estimating emissions from activities you don't control, using data you often don't have. Companies typically start with spend-based methods (multiplying procurement spend by industry-average emission factors), then progressively shift to supplier-specific data, activity-based calculations, and eventually primary data from key suppliers. This data quality journey takes years.

## Key Differences

**Control versus influence.** You can switch your facility to renewable energy or replace your fleet with EVs tomorrow — those are Scope 1 and 2 decisions within your authority. Reducing Scope 3 requires convincing suppliers to change their manufacturing processes, designing products that consume less energy during use, or shifting procurement to lower-carbon materials. This is influence, not control, and it's fundamentally harder.

**Measurement certainty.** Scope 1 data comes from fuel bills and direct measurement — accuracy within 5% is achievable. Scope 2 uses utility data and published grid factors — still quite precise. Scope 3 estimates can carry uncertainty margins of 30-50% or more, particularly for categories relying on spend-based methods and industry-average emission factors.

**Materiality.** For most companies outside heavy industry and utilities, Scope 3 is where the climate impact actually lives. A company that proudly reduces Scope 1 and 2 by 50% while ignoring a Scope 3 footprint ten times larger has addressed maybe 5% of its actual climate impact. This is why investors and regulators increasingly demand Scope 3 transparency.

**Reduction pathways.** Scope 1 and 2 reductions follow well-established playbooks: energy efficiency, renewable energy procurement, electrification, process optimization. Scope 3 reduction requires more creative strategies: supplier engagement programs, product redesign, circular economy models, customer behavior change, and procurement policy shifts.

**Regulatory treatment.** Historically, only Scope 1 and 2 were regulated. That's changing. CSRD, California SB 253, SBTi targets, and CDP questionnaires all now require Scope 3 disclosure or target-setting. The regulatory gap between Scopes 1-2 and Scope 3 is closing rapidly.

## When to Focus on Each

**Start with Scope 1 and 2 if**: you're early in your sustainability journey and need a solid emissions inventory foundation. Get your direct emissions measured accurately, set reduction targets, and build internal capability before tackling the value chain.

**Prioritize Scope 3 if**: you already have good Scope 1 and 2 data and your value chain emissions are significantly larger (which they usually are). Focus on the 2-3 categories that dominate your Scope 3 footprint rather than trying to measure all 15 categories with equal precision.

**Address both simultaneously if**: you're setting SBTi targets, preparing for CSRD, or responding to investor pressure through CDP. These frameworks require comprehensive inventories covering all material scopes.

## Council Fire's Perspective

We tell clients: don't let Scope 3 complexity become an excuse for inaction. The perfect Scope 3 inventory doesn't exist — every company is working with estimates and improving over time. What matters is starting, screening all 15 categories to identify hotspots, and focusing supplier engagement where it'll have the most impact.

The companies making real progress on Scope 3 treat it as a supply chain management challenge, not just an accounting exercise. They embed emissions criteria into procurement decisions, collaborate with key suppliers on reduction plans, and use Scope 3 data to inform product design and business model decisions. That's where Scope 3 measurement translates into actual emissions reductions — and where the competitive advantage lies.
