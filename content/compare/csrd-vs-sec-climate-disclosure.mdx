  - question: "Do I need to comply with both CSRD and SEC climate disclosure?"
    answer: "If you're a large company with EU operations meeting CSRD thresholds and you're also an SEC registrant, yes. Many multinationals face dual compliance. The good news: CSRD's broader scope means data collected for CSRD often covers SEC requirements, though reporting formats differ."
  - question: "Which rule is more demanding?"
    answer: "CSRD is significantly broader. It covers all ESG topics through the European Sustainability Reporting Standards (ESRS), while the SEC rule focuses narrowly on climate. CSRD also requires double materiality assessment, third-party assurance, and covers the full value chain including Scope 3 for material topics."
  - question: "What happens if I only comply with one?"
    answer: "Non-compliance with CSRD carries penalties set by EU member states — fines, public naming, and potential restrictions on EU market access. SEC non-compliance risks enforcement actions, restatements, and investor lawsuits. Neither substitutes for the other."
  - question: "Can I use one report for both?"
    answer: "Not directly. CSRD requires reporting under ESRS in a digital XBRL format filed with EU business registers. SEC requires specific forms (10-K amendments) filed with EDGAR. However, you can build a unified data collection process and produce both outputs from a single data infrastructure."

## Quick Comparison

- **Scope**: CSRD covers all ESG topics (environment, social, governance) through 12 ESRS standards. The SEC rule covers climate-related risks, greenhouse gas emissions, and climate governance only.
- **Who must comply**: CSRD applies to ~50,000 companies including non-EU companies with significant EU revenue (€150M+). The SEC rule applies to SEC registrants — roughly 10,000 public companies listed on US exchanges.
- **Materiality approach**: CSRD uses double materiality (financial impact AND impact on people/environment). The SEC uses financial materiality only (what affects investors).
- **Emissions reporting**: CSRD requires Scope 1, 2, and 3 where material. The SEC requires Scope 1 and 2 for large accelerated filers, with Scope 3 disclosure dropped from the final rule.
- **Assurance**: CSRD requires limited assurance from the start, moving to reasonable assurance. The SEC requires attestation of Scope 1 and 2 for large accelerated filers.
- **Timeline**: CSRD phased in from 2024 (large public companies) through 2029. SEC rule phased in starting fiscal year 2025 for large accelerated filers.
- **Format**: CSRD reports filed digitally in XHTML with XBRL tagging. SEC disclosures filed within annual reports (10-K) on EDGAR.

## What is the CSRD?

The Corporate Sustainability Reporting Directive replaced the EU's Non-Financial Reporting Directive (NFRD) and represents the most ambitious mandatory sustainability disclosure regime globally. Adopted in January 2023, it requires companies to report against the European Sustainability Reporting Standards (ESRS) — a detailed set of standards covering climate change, pollution, water, biodiversity, workforce conditions, affected communities, consumers, and business conduct.

What makes CSRD distinctive is double materiality. Companies must report on sustainability matters that are financially material (affecting enterprise value) AND matters where the company's operations impact people and the environment, regardless of financial effect. This means a company must disclose its water pollution impacts even if those impacts don't currently threaten its bottom line.

CSRD also reaches beyond EU-headquartered companies. Non-EU companies generating €150 million or more in EU net revenue with at least one EU subsidiary or branch must comply starting in 2029. This extraterritorial reach means US, UK, and Asian multinationals with significant European operations need to prepare.

## What is the SEC Climate Disclosure Rule?

The SEC's climate-related disclosure rule, finalized in March 2024, requires public companies registered with the SEC to disclose climate-related risks, governance, strategy, risk management processes, greenhouse gas emissions, and climate-related financial statement metrics. It's narrower than CSRD by design — the SEC's mandate is investor protection, not broad sustainability transformation.

The final rule was significantly scaled back from the 2022 proposal. Scope 3 emissions reporting was dropped entirely. Safe harbor provisions were added for forward-looking climate statements. The phase-in timeline was extended. Legal challenges delayed implementation, but the rule is now moving forward with compliance beginning for large accelerated filers.

The SEC rule uses financial materiality as its sole lens. Companies disclose climate information that a reasonable investor would consider important in making investment decisions. This means climate impacts on the company, not the company's impact on the climate — a fundamental philosophical difference from CSRD.

## Key Differences

**Breadth of coverage.** This is the most significant gap. CSRD is a comprehensive sustainability disclosure law covering environmental, social, and governance topics across 12 standards with over 1,000 data points. The SEC rule is a climate-only disclosure requirement. A company compliant with the SEC rule has addressed perhaps 15-20% of what CSRD demands.

**Materiality philosophy.** Double materiality (CSRD) versus single financial materiality (SEC) changes what gets reported. Under CSRD, a company with no financial exposure to climate transition risk still reports on its emissions if those emissions materially affect the environment. Under the SEC rule, that same company might legitimately determine climate disclosure is immaterial.

**Scope 3 emissions.** CSRD requires Scope 3 reporting where material under the climate change standard (ESRS E1), with a phase-in allowing companies to omit Scope 3 in year one. The SEC dropped Scope 3 entirely from the final rule. For many companies, Scope 3 represents 70-90% of total emissions, making this a substantial disclosure gap.

**Assurance requirements.** CSRD mandates independent assurance from the outset — limited assurance initially, progressing to reasonable assurance. The SEC requires attestation only for Scope 1 and 2 emissions from large accelerated filers, with no assurance required for qualitative climate risk disclosures.

**Extraterritorial reach.** Both rules reach beyond their home jurisdictions. CSRD captures non-EU companies with €150M+ EU revenue. The SEC captures any company listed on US exchanges regardless of domicile. A large European company listed on the NYSE faces both.

**Enforcement teeth.** CSRD enforcement varies by member state but includes financial penalties and public disclosure of non-compliance. SEC enforcement includes civil penalties, consent orders, and the chilling effect of securities fraud liability for materially misleading disclosures.

## When to Use Each

**Focus on CSRD compliance first if**: you have significant EU operations, you're approaching CSRD thresholds, or you want the most comprehensive sustainability data infrastructure. CSRD's broader scope means building for CSRD naturally covers SEC climate requirements.

**Focus on SEC compliance first if**: you're a US-listed company without significant EU exposure, and climate is your primary regulatory concern. The SEC rule is narrower and faster to implement.

**Build for both simultaneously if**: you're a multinational with SEC filing obligations and CSRD applicability. A unified data collection strategy avoids duplicate work. Many companies are building centralized ESG data platforms that output both ESRS-formatted reports and SEC-compliant disclosures.

## Council Fire's Perspective

We advise multinational clients to treat CSRD as the ceiling, not the floor. If you build your sustainability data infrastructure to meet CSRD's double materiality requirements across all ESRS topics, generating SEC-compliant climate disclosures becomes a subset exercise. The reverse doesn't work — building only for the SEC rule leaves enormous gaps when CSRD obligations arrive.

The practical reality is that these two regimes reflect fundamentally different theories about what corporate disclosure is for. The EU sees disclosure as a tool for driving sustainable behavior. The SEC sees it as a tool for informing investors. Companies caught between both systems need to satisfy each regulator on its own terms while finding operational efficiencies in shared data collection. That's where we focus our implementation work — building once, reporting twice.
