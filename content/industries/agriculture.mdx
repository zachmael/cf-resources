## Industry Overview

Agriculture is both a major contributor to climate change and one of its most vulnerable victims. The sector accounts for approximately 10-12% of global greenhouse gas emissions directly—rising to roughly 22% when land-use change and deforestation for agricultural expansion are included. Methane from livestock and rice cultivation, nitrous oxide from fertilizer application, and CO2 from soil disturbance and machinery represent the primary emission sources. Simultaneously, agriculture depends on stable climate patterns for predictable growing seasons, water availability, and pest management—all of which are being disrupted.

The economic stakes are enormous. Agriculture employs over 1 billion people globally and underpins food security for 8 billion. In the U.S., agricultural output exceeds $400 billion annually. Climate impacts—droughts, floods, heat stress, shifting pest patterns—are already affecting yields and increasing input costs. The 2023 crop year saw significant losses from drought across the U.S. Southern Plains and flooding in California's Central Valley, previewing the volatility that climate models project will intensify.

The sustainability opportunity in agriculture is uniquely compelling because the sector can transition from carbon source to carbon sink. Healthy soils are the largest terrestrial carbon reservoir, holding more carbon than the atmosphere and all vegetation combined. Regenerative practices that rebuild soil organic matter—cover cropping, reduced tillage, diverse rotations, integrated livestock management—sequester carbon while improving farm resilience, reducing input costs, and maintaining or improving yields. This dual benefit makes agricultural sustainability a rare case where environmental and economic interests are deeply aligned.

## Key Sustainability Challenges

### Emissions from Livestock and Fertilizer

Livestock production contributes approximately 14.5% of global GHG emissions, primarily through enteric fermentation (methane from cattle digestion), manure management, and feed production. Reducing livestock emissions without reducing production requires a portfolio of interventions: feed additives that inhibit methane production, improved manure management systems, genetic selection for efficiency, and grazing management practices. Synthetic nitrogen fertilizer production is energy-intensive, and its application releases nitrous oxide—a GHG with 265 times the warming potential of CO2. Precision application, enhanced efficiency fertilizers, and biological nitrogen fixation offer reduction pathways.

### Water Scarcity and Quality

Agriculture consumes approximately 70% of global freshwater withdrawals. Irrigation efficiency varies enormously—flood irrigation may deliver 30-40% of water to crops, while drip systems achieve 90%+. Groundwater depletion is accelerating in critical aquifers (Ogallala, Central Valley, North China Plain). Agricultural runoff—carrying nitrogen, phosphorus, and pesticides—is the leading source of water quality impairment in U.S. waterways. Sustainable water management requires both efficiency improvements and fundamental changes to cropping systems and drainage management.

### Biodiversity and Ecosystem Services

Agricultural expansion is the primary driver of biodiversity loss globally. Monoculture cropping systems, pesticide use, and habitat conversion have decimated pollinator populations, soil microbiome diversity, and wildlife corridors. This loss undermines the ecosystem services that agriculture itself depends on—pollination, natural pest control, soil formation, and water filtration. Reversing this trend requires landscape-level planning that integrates production with habitat conservation, buffer zones, and diversified cropping systems.

## Regulatory Landscape

Agricultural emissions regulation has historically been lighter than other sectors, reflecting political sensitivity around food production and rural livelihoods. However, this is changing. The EU's Common Agricultural Policy (CAP) now links a significant portion of farm subsidies to environmental conditionality, including soil management, biodiversity, and nutrient management requirements. The EU Farm to Fork Strategy sets ambitious targets for pesticide reduction, organic farming expansion, and fertilizer reduction.

In the U.S., agricultural emissions regulation remains largely voluntary, operating through USDA conservation programs (CRP, EQIP, CSP) that incentivize sustainable practices. The Inflation Reduction Act allocated $19.5 billion in additional conservation funding—the largest single investment in agricultural conservation in U.S. history. California's CARB has included agricultural emissions in its cap-and-trade program considerations, and state-level nutrient management regulations apply in many jurisdictions.

Voluntary carbon markets offer farmers a potential revenue stream for adopting carbon-sequestering practices, though market maturity, price levels, and verification costs remain challenges. The USDA's Climate-Smart Commodities program invested $3.1 billion in projects that quantify and verify the climate benefits of sustainable agricultural practices.

## Opportunities

Regenerative agriculture represents the most promising pathway for agricultural sustainability. Practices including cover cropping, no-till and reduced tillage, diverse crop rotations, and integrated crop-livestock systems can reduce input costs by 20-40% (less fertilizer, less pesticide) while maintaining or improving yields after a transition period. The Rodale Institute's 40-year Farming Systems Trial demonstrates that regenerative organic systems match conventional yields while building soil health, sequestering carbon, and using 45% less energy.

Precision agriculture technology—GPS-guided equipment, variable-rate application, remote sensing, and data analytics—enables farmers to optimize input use with field-level precision. Applying exactly the right amount of fertilizer, water, and pesticide where it's needed reduces both costs and environmental impact. The precision agriculture market is projected to exceed $15 billion by 2028.

Agricultural carbon credits and ecosystem service payments represent emerging revenue streams. While prices remain modest ($10-25 per tonne of CO2e in voluntary markets), they are expected to increase as corporate demand for nature-based offsets grows and verification methodologies improve. Farmers who establish baselines and adopt verified practices now will be well-positioned as markets mature.

## How Council Fire Can Help

Council Fire works with agricultural operations, food companies, and public agencies to develop and implement climate-smart agricultural strategies. We support GHG inventories for farm operations and agricultural supply chains, design regenerative transition programs, and help organizations access conservation funding and carbon market opportunities.

Our team understands the practical realities of farming—capital constraints, risk aversion, and the multi-year timelines required for agronomic transitions. We develop strategies that work within these constraints, starting with financially accretive practices and building toward deeper transformation over time. For food companies seeking to decarbonize their agricultural supply chains, we design farmer engagement programs that provide technical assistance, financial incentives, and long-term purchasing commitments.

## Frequently Asked Questions

### How long does it take for regenerative practices to show results?

Soil health improvements begin immediately, but measurable yield and economic benefits typically emerge over 3-5 years. Cover crops improve soil structure and biological activity within 2-3 seasons. Reduced tillage systems show soil organic carbon increases within 3-5 years. Input cost reductions (lower fertilizer and pesticide spend) often begin in year 2-3 as soil biology improves nutrient cycling. The transition period can include yield dips of 5-15% in some systems, which is why financial support during transition—through conservation programs, premium markets, or company-sponsored programs—is important.

### Are agricultural carbon credits credible and worth pursuing?

Credibility depends on the verification methodology and project design. Credits generated under established protocols (Verra, Gold Standard, Climate Action Reserve) with robust monitoring, reporting, and verification (MRV) are generally credible. Key quality indicators include additionality (practices wouldn't have been adopted without credit revenue), permanence (carbon storage is maintained over time), and conservative quantification. Current prices ($10-25/tonne) are modest relative to practice change costs, so credits work best as a supplementary revenue stream alongside input cost savings and premium market access rather than as the sole economic driver for practice change.

### What is the USDA Climate-Smart Commodities program?

The Climate-Smart Commodities program is a $3.1 billion USDA initiative funding projects that create market opportunities for U.S. agricultural commodities produced using climate-smart practices. Funded projects must quantify the GHG benefits of climate-smart practices, develop markets for climate-smart commodities, and provide direct benefits to producers—particularly small and underserved operations. Over 140 projects were funded in 2022-2023, ranging from large-scale supply chain programs run by companies like ADM and Cargill to university-led research projects. The program is significant because it creates a framework for verifying and marketing the climate benefits of sustainable agricultural practices at commercial scale.
