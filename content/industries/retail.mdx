## Industry Overview

Retail sits at the intersection of global supply chains and consumer behavior, giving the sector both outsized environmental impact and unusual leverage to drive change. While retailers' direct operational emissions (stores, distribution centers, corporate offices) are modest relative to their revenue, their Scope 3 emissions—embedded in the products they source, transport, and sell—are enormous. Walmart's Scope 3 emissions, for instance, exceed those of many countries.

Consumer expectations around sustainability continue to evolve, though the relationship between stated preferences and purchasing behavior remains complex. What's unambiguous is the regulatory trajectory: the EU's CSRD, Green Claims Directive, and Digital Product Passport requirements are creating a new compliance baseline for retailers operating in European markets. The era of vague sustainability marketing is ending, replaced by demands for verifiable data and transparent supply chains.

The retail sector is also ground zero for the plastics and packaging debate. Retailers are the primary interface between packaged products and consumers, making them targets for EPR legislation and packaging reduction mandates. Simultaneously, the rise of recommerce, rental, and refurbishment models is challenging the linear "sell more stuff" business model that has defined retail for decades. Retailers that adapt their business models to circular principles will capture emerging consumer segments and reduce exposure to resource price volatility.

## Key Sustainability Challenges

### Supply Chain Complexity and Transparency

Large retailers source from tens of thousands of suppliers across dozens of countries. Mapping environmental and social conditions across these supply chains is a massive data challenge. Modern slavery risks, deforestation linkages, chemical safety, and carbon intensity vary enormously across supply bases. Regulations like the EU Corporate Sustainability Due Diligence Directive and Germany's Supply Chain Act require retailers to identify, prevent, and mitigate adverse impacts throughout their value chains—moving beyond auditing to active risk management.

### Scope 3 Emissions Measurement and Reduction

For retailers, Scope 3 typically represents 95%+ of total emissions. Measuring these emissions accurately requires data from thousands of suppliers, many of which lack the capacity to calculate their own carbon footprints. Retailer-led programs like Walmart's Project Gigaton and Target's sustainability goals push emissions reduction expectations onto suppliers, but the data infrastructure and verification mechanisms remain underdeveloped.

### Green Claims and Consumer Trust

Consumer skepticism around sustainability claims is rising, fueled by high-profile greenwashing scandals and confusing label proliferation. The EU's Green Claims Directive will require companies to substantiate environmental claims with scientific evidence and standardized methodologies. Retailers must navigate an increasingly complex landscape of certifications, labels, and standards while maintaining credibility with increasingly informed consumers.

## Regulatory Landscape

The EU is implementing the most comprehensive set of retail sustainability regulations globally. The CSRD requires detailed sustainability reporting. The Green Claims Directive mandates substantiation of environmental marketing claims. The Ecodesign for Sustainable Products Regulation will establish sustainability requirements for products sold in the EU, including digital product passports. EPR schemes for packaging, textiles, and electronics impose financial responsibility on producers and retailers for end-of-life management.

In the U.S., the FTC's Green Guides govern environmental marketing claims, with an ongoing revision expected to address carbon neutrality claims and recyclability. California's Plastic Pollution Prevention and Packaging Producer Responsibility Act (SB 54) mandates that all packaging be recyclable or compostable by 2032 and includes 65% source reduction requirements for single-use plastics. Several states have implemented textile EPR or are considering legislation.

Globally, the Textile Exchange, Sustainable Apparel Coalition (SAC), and Consumer Goods Forum provide industry-level frameworks for sustainability measurement and reporting.

## Opportunities

Circular business models represent the most significant strategic opportunity. Recommerce (resale of used products), rental, repair, and refurbishment programs extend product lifetimes, create new revenue streams, and build customer loyalty. The global secondhand market is projected to reach $350 billion by 2028. Retailers including Patagonia, REI, IKEA, and Lululemon have demonstrated that circular offerings can be commercially successful.

Supply chain sustainability programs create competitive advantages through risk reduction and innovation. Retailers with robust supplier engagement programs identify risks earlier, build stronger supplier relationships, and access preferential financing. The Higg Index, CDP Supply Chain, and similar tools enable standardized measurement and benchmarking across supply bases.

Private label sustainability leadership allows retailers to differentiate their owned brands with credible sustainability attributes—certified organic, Fair Trade, recycled content, low-carbon—without depending on national brands to lead. Private label represents 20-30% of sales for most major retailers and offers the greatest control over sustainability specifications.

## How Council Fire Can Help

Council Fire works with retailers to build sustainability programs that span operations, supply chains, and consumer engagement. We develop Scope 3 measurement and reduction strategies, design supplier engagement programs, and support compliance with emerging regulations including CSRD, CSDDD, and green claims requirements. Our team helps retailers evaluate and implement circular business models with credible financial projections.

For consumer-facing sustainability communications, we provide green claims substantiation review, certification strategy, and messaging frameworks that build trust without overpromising. Our retail experience spans grocery, apparel, home goods, and specialty retail—we understand the margin pressures and competitive dynamics that shape what's possible.

## Frequently Asked Questions

### How do we start measuring Scope 3 emissions across a massive supplier base?

Begin with a spend-based screening using industry-average emission factors to identify your highest-emitting product categories and suppliers. Then prioritize direct engagement with the top 50-100 suppliers by emissions (which typically represent 60-80% of your supply chain footprint). Use standardized platforms—CDP Supply Chain, Higg Index, or custom data collection tools—to gather primary emissions data from priority suppliers. Set year-over-year improvement expectations and provide technical assistance to suppliers who need help measuring their footprints. Accept that precision will improve over time; the goal in year one is a directionally accurate baseline.

### What is the EU Digital Product Passport and when does it take effect?

The Digital Product Passport (DPP) is a digital record that will accompany products sold in the EU, containing information about origin, composition, repairability, recyclability, and environmental impact. It will be accessible via QR code or digital link. DPPs will roll out in phases starting with batteries (2027), followed by textiles, electronics, and other product categories. The DPP is part of the Ecodesign for Sustainable Products Regulation and represents a fundamental shift toward product-level transparency. Retailers should begin preparing by auditing product data availability, engaging suppliers on data collection, and evaluating IT infrastructure for managing digital product information at scale.

### How do we substantiate sustainability claims under the EU Green Claims Directive?

The directive requires that environmental claims be based on recognized scientific evidence, consider the full product lifecycle, identify significant environmental aspects, and demonstrate that the product's environmental performance goes beyond legal requirements. Claims must be verified by an independent third-party auditor. Generic claims like "eco-friendly" or "green" without specific substantiation will be prohibited. Carbon neutrality claims based solely on offsets are expected to face particular scrutiny. Retailers should audit all current environmental marketing claims, map them to supporting evidence, and identify gaps where substantiation is insufficient.
