## Industry Overview

The hospitality industry—hotels, resorts, restaurants, event venues, and cruise lines—operates in a sector where guest experience and environmental impact are intimately connected. Hotels consume 10-20 times more energy per square meter than residential buildings. A single hotel guest generates an average of 1 kg of waste per night. The global hotel industry alone accounts for approximately 1% of global carbon emissions—a figure that scales considerably when restaurants, events, and tourism transportation are included.

The COVID-19 pandemic devastated the industry but also catalyzed a rethinking of operational models. Properties that emerged from the downturn invested in efficiency upgrades, reduced-contact service models, and technology-enabled operations that simultaneously improved margins and environmental performance. The recovery period has coincided with heightened guest awareness of sustainability—particularly among business travelers whose companies require carbon reporting for travel emissions.

Major hotel brands have responded with escalating commitments. Hilton's Travel with Purpose program targets 50% reductions in environmental impact by 2030. Marriott has set science-based targets. Accor's Planet 21 program addresses carbon, water, food waste, and biodiversity. But implementation remains uneven, particularly across franchised properties where brand standards and owner investment decisions don't always align. The gap between corporate commitments and property-level execution represents both the industry's greatest sustainability challenge and its largest opportunity.

## Key Sustainability Challenges

### Energy Management Across Diverse Properties

Hotel energy profiles vary enormously by climate, property type, age, and guest mix. A ski resort has a fundamentally different energy profile than a tropical beach property. Managing energy performance across portfolios of hundreds or thousands of properties—many independently owned and operated under franchise agreements—requires standardized benchmarking, tailored intervention strategies, and incentive alignment between brands and owners. Common energy waste points include HVAC in unoccupied rooms, kitchen exhaust systems, laundry operations, and pool heating.

### Food Waste and Single-Use Items

Hospitality generates substantial food waste—hotels waste an estimated 25-40% of food purchased. Buffet service, unpredictable occupancy, and guest expectations for abundant food choices all contribute. Beyond food, single-use amenity bottles, individually wrapped items, and disposable service ware create significant waste streams. Reducing waste without diminishing guest experience requires operational redesign, staff training, and guest communication that frames sustainability as a quality enhancement rather than a service reduction.

### Water Consumption

Hotels are water-intensive operations. Laundry, pools, spas, landscaping, kitchens, and guest rooms all contribute to consumption that can exceed 500 liters per guest night in full-service resorts. In water-stressed destinations—which include many popular tourism markets—hotel water consumption creates community tension and regulatory risk. Water efficiency investments are among the highest-return sustainability measures available, yet they often receive less attention than energy or waste.

## Regulatory Landscape

The EU's CSRD applies to large hospitality companies, requiring comprehensive sustainability reporting. The Energy Efficiency Directive sets targets for building renovations that affect hotel properties. Several European countries and cities impose tourist accommodation sustainability requirements—the Balearic Islands, Amsterdam, and Barcelona have all implemented regulations affecting hotel environmental performance.

In the U.S., federal regulation is limited, but city-level building performance standards (New York Local Law 97, Boston BERDO) apply to large hotels. California's water restrictions affect hospitality operations. Health department regulations govern food waste management and donation. The EPA's ENERGY STAR program provides hospitality-specific benchmarking through Portfolio Manager.

Industry-specific frameworks include the Cornell Hotel Sustainability Benchmarking (CHSB) Index, the Global Sustainable Tourism Council (GSTC) criteria, and LEED for Hospitality certification. The Sustainable Hospitality Alliance provides sector-specific guidance on carbon, water, and waste management.

## Opportunities

Energy efficiency investments deliver the strongest and most immediate returns in hospitality. LED lighting, occupancy-based HVAC controls, heat pump water heating, and kitchen ventilation optimization typically achieve payback periods under three years. Properties that benchmark with ENERGY STAR and implement systematic energy management programs report 15-30% reductions in energy costs.

Sustainability as a differentiator is particularly relevant in hospitality, where it aligns with premium positioning. Properties with credible sustainability credentials attract corporate groups (whose travel policies increasingly require sustainable options), luxury travelers (who associate sustainability with quality), and event planners (who face attendee expectations for sustainable venues). Green certifications and transparent reporting serve as proof points.

Technology solutions—smart building systems, digital guest communication, predictive maintenance—simultaneously improve operational efficiency and sustainability performance. Properties that invest in building management systems (BMS) with real-time monitoring gain both cost savings and the data infrastructure needed for credible sustainability reporting.

## How Council Fire Can Help

Council Fire works with hotel brands, management companies, and property owners to develop sustainability strategies that enhance both environmental performance and guest experience. We conduct property-level energy and water audits, develop portfolio-wide benchmarking programs, and design brand-level sustainability standards that accommodate the diversity of franchise operations.

Our team supports science-based target setting, Scope 3 measurement (including the unique challenge of franchise emissions), and reporting aligned with GSTC, GRI, and hospitality-specific frameworks. For properties pursuing certifications, we provide gap analysis and implementation support. Our hospitality clients value our ability to translate sustainability ambition into practical, property-level action plans that respect operational constraints and owner economics.

## Frequently Asked Questions

### How do we reduce food waste without diminishing guest experience?

Effective food waste reduction actually enhances quality by focusing on freshness and intentionality. Start with measurement—track waste by source (kitchen prep, buffet, plate waste, spoilage) to identify priorities. Replace standing buffets with made-to-order stations and smaller, more frequently refreshed displays. Implement demand forecasting using occupancy data and historical patterns. Train kitchen staff on trim optimization and cross-utilization of ingredients. Implement guest-facing communication that frames reduced waste as a quality choice. Properties implementing comprehensive food waste programs typically achieve 30-50% reductions while maintaining or improving guest satisfaction scores.

### What is ENERGY STAR Portfolio Manager and how do we use it for hotel benchmarking?

ENERGY STAR Portfolio Manager is a free EPA tool that allows building owners to track energy and water consumption and benchmark performance against similar properties nationally. Hotels receive a 1-100 score based on energy use intensity normalized for climate, size, and operating characteristics. A score of 50 represents median performance; 75 qualifies for ENERGY STAR certification. To use it, enter monthly utility data for each property, input building characteristics, and review benchmarking results. Many hotel brands require Portfolio Manager tracking across their portfolios. It's the most widely used hospitality energy benchmarking tool and provides a credible, standardized performance metric.

### How do we align franchise sustainability requirements with owner investment decisions?

This is the central governance challenge in hospitality sustainability. Effective approaches include: establishing minimum sustainability standards in franchise agreements (increasingly common in new agreements), providing technical assistance and preferred vendor programs that reduce owner implementation costs, sharing energy benchmarking data so owners can see their performance relative to peers, offering sustainability-linked incentive fee structures, and demonstrating ROI through case studies from early-adopter properties. The most successful brands treat sustainability as a brand standard—like design or service quality—rather than an optional add-on.
