## Industry Overview

Telecommunications infrastructure is the nervous system of the modern economy—carrying the data that powers commerce, healthcare, education, and governance. This essential role comes with a growing environmental footprint. The ICT sector as a whole accounts for approximately 2-4% of global GHG emissions, with telecom networks representing a significant share through energy-intensive base stations, data centers, fiber and copper networks, and vast fleets of service vehicles.

The sector faces a fundamental tension: demand for data is growing exponentially (global IP traffic is projected to triple between 2022 and 2028), while the energy required to carry each bit must decrease dramatically to prevent the sector's carbon footprint from spiraling. The transition from 4G to 5G illustrates this challenge—5G is more energy-efficient per gigabyte but requires denser network deployments that increase total energy consumption. Fixed-line networks face similar dynamics as fiber-to-the-home rollouts expand.

Telecom operators are also significant consumers of electronic equipment with relatively short refresh cycles. Network equipment, customer premises devices, and mobile handsets generate substantial e-waste streams. At the same time, the sector has unique leverage: by enabling remote work, smart buildings, precision agriculture, and connected logistics, telecommunications can reduce emissions in other sectors by a factor of 5-10 times its own footprint. Quantifying and communicating this "enablement effect" is increasingly central to the sector's sustainability narrative.

## Key Sustainability Challenges

### Network Energy Consumption

Radio access networks (base stations) typically consume 60-80% of a telecom operator's total energy. With 5G densification requiring more base stations and massive MIMO antenna arrays, network energy demand is increasing even as per-bit efficiency improves. Operators in developing markets often rely on diesel generators for off-grid tower sites, adding both cost and emissions. Strategies for network energy reduction include AI-driven sleep modes (shutting down capacity during low-traffic periods), advanced cooling for equipment shelters, and renewable energy procurement or on-site generation.

### Equipment Lifecycle and E-Waste

Telecom networks require regular equipment refreshes—typically every 5-7 years for core and radio equipment. Customer premises equipment (routers, set-top boxes) turns over even more frequently. Mobile handset lifecycles average 2-3 years in developed markets. This produces significant volumes of electronic waste containing hazardous materials alongside valuable recoverable resources. Extended equipment lifecycles, refurbishment programs, and circular design principles can reduce both waste and procurement costs, but they require changes to vendor relationships and network planning assumptions.

### Digital Divide and Social Sustainability

Sustainability in telecom extends beyond environmental metrics to include digital inclusion. An estimated 2.7 billion people globally lack internet access, and the digital divide correlates closely with economic inequality. Telecom operators face expectations to extend coverage to underserved areas—often the most expensive to serve—while maintaining financial viability. Bridging the digital divide is both a social imperative and a market opportunity, but it requires innovative business models and public-private partnerships.

## Regulatory Landscape

The EU's CSRD applies to large telecom operators, requiring comprehensive sustainability reporting across environmental, social, and governance dimensions. The European Electronic Communications Code includes provisions for network sharing and infrastructure efficiency. The EU's Ecodesign for Sustainable Products Regulation will establish durability and repairability requirements for electronic equipment including network devices.

In the U.S., the FCC oversees spectrum management and broadband deployment, with growing attention to the environmental impact of network infrastructure. The EPA regulates hazardous materials in electronic equipment. The Broadband Equity, Access, and Deployment (BEAD) program provides $42.5 billion for broadband infrastructure, with climate resilience and environmental justice considerations embedded in state grant programs.

Industry frameworks include the GSMA's Pathways towards a Low-Carbon Telecoms Sector and the ITU's standards on ICT environmental impact assessment. The Science Based Targets initiative has developed sector-specific guidance for ICT companies. The Joint Audit Cooperation (JAC) provides supply chain sustainability assessment specifically for the telecom sector.

## Opportunities

Energy efficiency improvements offer the strongest near-term returns. AI-driven network optimization—dynamically adjusting capacity to match demand—can reduce radio access network energy consumption by 15-25%. Modern base station hardware is significantly more energy-efficient than legacy equipment, making network modernization both a technology upgrade and a sustainability investment. Operators who lock in renewable energy through long-term PPAs achieve cost stability while reducing emissions.

The enablement narrative is a powerful differentiator. Telecom operators can quantify how their services reduce emissions across customer segments—video conferencing replacing business travel, IoT sensors optimizing industrial processes, smart grid management enabled by connectivity. The GSMA estimates that mobile technology enabled a 2.1 billion tonne CO2e reduction in 2022—roughly 10 times the sector's own footprint. Companies that articulate and substantiate this enablement case strengthen their ESG positioning with investors and regulators.

Network sharing and infrastructure co-investment reduce both capital expenditure and environmental impact. Tower companies (American Tower, Crown Castle, Cellnex) have built businesses around shared infrastructure. Active network sharing agreements, while competitively sensitive, are growing in markets where regulators encourage them. Each shared tower avoids the environmental impact of a redundant installation.

## How Council Fire Can Help

Council Fire advises telecom operators, tower companies, and equipment manufacturers on sustainability strategy tailored to the sector's unique characteristics. We develop network-level carbon assessments, energy efficiency roadmaps, and renewable energy procurement strategies. Our team supports Scope 3 measurement across complex vendor ecosystems and customer-use emission calculations.

For operators navigating CSRD reporting, SBTi target-setting, or enablement quantification, we provide methodological frameworks and implementation support. We understand the capital-intensive, infrastructure-heavy nature of telecom operations and develop sustainability strategies that integrate with network planning and investment cycles rather than competing with them.

## Frequently Asked Questions

### How do we reduce base station energy consumption without affecting network quality?

Modern approaches include AI-driven sleep modes that power down MIMO antenna elements, carriers, or entire sectors during low-traffic periods (typically achieving 10-20% savings), advanced cooling systems (free cooling, liquid cooling) that reduce HVAC energy, and hardware refresh to more efficient equipment generations. The key is balancing energy savings against service quality commitments—sleep mode algorithms must maintain coverage and quality thresholds. Network densification through small cells can actually improve both coverage and energy efficiency by placing capacity closer to users, reducing transmission power requirements.

### What is the telecom sector's "enablement effect" and how do we quantify it?

The enablement effect refers to the GHG emissions reductions enabled in other sectors by telecom services—for example, remote work reducing commuting emissions, or IoT sensors optimizing building energy use. Quantification follows methodologies developed by the GSMA, GeSI (Global Enabling Sustainability Initiative), and ITU. The approach compares emissions in a scenario with the telecom-enabled service versus a counterfactual without it. For instance, a video conference displacing a flight saves the emissions difference between the two activities. The GSMA estimates global mobile enablement at approximately 10x the sector's own carbon footprint. Individual operators can calculate their enablement effect using customer data and published methodologies.

### Should telecom companies set science-based targets?

Yes. The SBTi has developed ICT sector-specific guidance that accounts for the sector's unique characteristics, including rapid traffic growth and the enablement effect. Over 50 telecom companies have committed to or set SBTi-approved targets. Setting SBTs demonstrates climate ambition to investors, satisfies the growing expectations of enterprise customers who include supplier climate commitments in procurement decisions, and provides a structured framework for internal decarbonization planning. The SBTi ICT guidance allows companies to set targets on an intensity basis (emissions per unit of data traffic) or absolute basis, providing flexibility for growing operators.
