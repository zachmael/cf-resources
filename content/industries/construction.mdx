## Industry Overview

Construction is responsible for roughly 11% of global greenhouse gas emissions through embodied carbon in building materials—primarily concrete, steel, and aluminum—and jobsite operations. When combined with the operational emissions of completed buildings, the construction and built environment sector accounts for nearly 40% of global energy-related emissions. This makes construction one of the most consequential sectors for climate action, yet it remains one of the slowest to adopt sustainable practices.

The industry's structure contributes to the challenge. Construction is highly fragmented, with millions of firms operating across complex project delivery chains. Margins are thin—typically 2-5%—creating resistance to any cost premium associated with sustainable materials or practices. Decision-making is distributed among owners, architects, engineers, general contractors, and subcontractors, each with different incentives and information. Innovation adoption is notoriously slow, with industry productivity growth lagging virtually every other sector for decades.

Despite these headwinds, change is accelerating. Whole-life carbon assessment is becoming standard practice in leading markets. Environmental Product Declarations (EPDs) are enabling material-level carbon comparisons. Governments are implementing buy-clean policies that require low-carbon materials in public projects. And a growing body of evidence demonstrates that low-carbon construction can be achieved at cost parity or near-parity with conventional approaches when design teams engage early and think systematically.

## Key Sustainability Challenges

### Embodied Carbon in Materials

Concrete is the most widely used man-made material on earth, and cement production alone accounts for approximately 8% of global CO2 emissions. Steel contributes another 7-9%. Reducing embodied carbon requires a combination of strategies: material substitution (supplementary cementite materials, mass timber, recycled steel), structural optimization (using less material through better design), and process decarbonization (green hydrogen for steelmaking, carbon capture at cement plants). Each approach is at a different stage of commercial readiness.

### Jobsite Waste and Resource Efficiency

Construction and demolition waste represents approximately 600 million tons annually in the U.S.—more than twice the volume of municipal solid waste. Typical construction projects send 30-40% of materials to landfill. While recycling rates for materials like concrete and steel are relatively high, wood, drywall, insulation, and mixed waste often end up in landfills. Reducing waste requires better design (modular construction, standardized dimensions), improved site management (material tracking, waste segregation), and stronger markets for recycled construction materials.

### Workforce and Safety

The construction industry faces chronic labor shortages, with an estimated 500,000 unfilled positions in the U.S. alone. Sustainable construction practices—including prefabrication, modular construction, and building information modeling (BIM)—can improve productivity and working conditions, helping attract and retain workers. However, these approaches require workforce training and cultural change in an industry where traditional methods are deeply entrenched.

## Regulatory Landscape

Buy-clean policies are proliferating. The U.S. Federal Buy Clean Initiative requires EPDs and establishes maximum embodied carbon limits for federally funded construction using steel, concrete, asphalt, and flat glass. California, Colorado, New York, and other states have adopted or are developing similar requirements. The EU's Construction Products Regulation revision will require lifecycle carbon assessment and EPDs for construction products.

Building codes are evolving to address embodied carbon alongside operational energy. The International Code Council's upcoming code cycles are expected to include embodied carbon provisions. Several jurisdictions—including Vancouver, the Netherlands, and Denmark—already require whole-life carbon assessments for new buildings.

Waste diversion requirements vary by jurisdiction. Many cities and states mandate construction and demolition waste recycling or diversion, with rates typically ranging from 50-75%. The EU's Waste Framework Directive targets 70% recovery of construction and demolition waste.

## Opportunities

Low-carbon materials are reaching commercial scale and cost competitiveness. Supplementary cementitious materials (fly ash, slag, calcined clay) can reduce concrete's carbon footprint by 30-50% with minimal cost impact. Mass timber construction is growing rapidly, with cross-laminated timber (CLT) enabling wood buildings up to 18 stories. Recycled steel produced in electric arc furnaces carries 60-75% lower emissions than virgin steel from blast furnaces.

Offsite and modular construction methods reduce waste by 50-90% compared to conventional site-built approaches while improving schedule predictability and quality control. The global modular construction market is projected to exceed $150 billion by 2028, driven by labor shortages and sustainability requirements.

Digital tools—BIM, digital twins, and material passports—enable better design optimization, waste reduction, and end-of-life material recovery planning. Companies that invest in digital capabilities gain both productivity and sustainability advantages.

## How Council Fire Can Help

Council Fire works with general contractors, developers, architects, and material suppliers to integrate sustainability into project delivery and business strategy. We conduct whole-life carbon assessments, develop material procurement strategies that minimize embodied carbon, and support EPD development and interpretation. Our team helps contractors establish waste diversion programs, measure and report project-level emissions, and pursue green building certifications.

For companies navigating buy-clean compliance, we provide gap analysis, EPD readiness assessments, and procurement strategies that meet carbon intensity thresholds. We understand construction's commercial pressures and focus on solutions that are technically sound, cost-competitive, and implementable within real project timelines.

## Frequently Asked Questions

### What is an Environmental Product Declaration and why does it matter?

An EPD is a standardized, third-party verified document that reports the environmental impacts of a product across its lifecycle, based on lifecycle assessment (LCA) methodology and governed by ISO 14025 and EN 15804 standards. EPDs quantify impacts including global warming potential, ozone depletion, acidification, and resource depletion. They matter because buy-clean policies increasingly require EPDs as a condition of product eligibility, and specifiers use them to compare the carbon intensity of competing products. For manufacturers, having EPDs is becoming a market access requirement rather than a differentiator.

### How much does low-carbon construction actually cost compared to conventional?

Research from the Carbon Leadership Forum and others consistently shows that low-carbon construction can be achieved at 0-2% cost premium when sustainability is integrated early in the design process. Structural optimization alone—using less material through better engineering—often reduces both cost and carbon simultaneously. Material substitution costs vary: supplementary cementitious materials in concrete are often cost-neutral or cost-saving, while mass timber may carry a 5-15% premium on structural framing but offers savings in construction speed and foundation sizing. The key variable is when sustainability enters the conversation—retrofitting low-carbon specifications onto a completed design is expensive, while designing for low carbon from the start is not.

### What is whole-life carbon and how is it different from operational carbon?

Whole-life carbon encompasses both embodied carbon (emissions from material extraction, manufacturing, transportation, construction, and end-of-life) and operational carbon (emissions from energy used to heat, cool, light, and operate the building over its lifetime). Historically, building regulations focused exclusively on operational energy. As buildings become more energy-efficient and grids decarbonize, embodied carbon represents an increasingly large share of whole-life emissions—often 50% or more for high-performance new buildings. Whole-life carbon assessment provides a complete picture and prevents burden-shifting between embodied and operational phases.
