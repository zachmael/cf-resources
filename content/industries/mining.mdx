## Industry Overview

Mining occupies a complex position in the sustainability landscape. The sector is a major source of environmental impact—responsible for 4-7% of global GHG emissions, significant water consumption and contamination risk, biodiversity disruption, and community displacement. At the same time, mining produces the raw materials essential for the clean energy transition: lithium, cobalt, copper, nickel, rare earth elements, and the iron ore and bauxite that become the steel and aluminum in wind turbines, EVs, and grid infrastructure. The world cannot decarbonize without mining more of these materials, creating a paradox that defines the sector's sustainability challenge.

The International Energy Agency projects that demand for critical minerals will increase 4-6 times by 2040 under net-zero scenarios. Copper demand for electrical applications alone is expected to double. Lithium demand could increase by a factor of 40. Meeting this demand sustainably—without replicating the environmental and social harms of historical mining—requires fundamental changes in how mines are planned, operated, and closed.

Investor and regulatory pressure is intensifying. Major mining companies face shareholder resolutions on climate, tailings management, Indigenous rights, and biodiversity. The catastrophic failures at Brumadinho (2019) and Samarco (2015) focused global attention on tailings dam safety. The emergence of responsible sourcing standards—driven by EV manufacturers and electronics companies—is creating demand-side pressure for mines that can demonstrate sustainable operations and transparent supply chains.

## Key Sustainability Challenges

### Decarbonizing Mining Operations

Mining operations are energy-intensive, relying on diesel for haul trucks and mobile equipment, natural gas or coal for processing heat, and grid electricity for ventilation, pumping, and mineral processing. Scope 1 and 2 emissions are significant, but the pathway to reduction varies by mine type. Open-pit operations can electrify haul fleets (battery-electric and trolley-assist trucks are entering commercial service), while underground mines can transition ventilation and drilling to electric systems. Processing emissions depend on the specific mineral and technology. Renewable energy procurement is straightforward where grid connections exist but challenging for remote mine sites.

### Water Management and Contamination Risk

Mining operations interact with water systems at every stage—dewatering to access ore bodies, using water in processing, managing acid mine drainage, and treating discharge. In water-scarce regions, mine water consumption competes with community and agricultural needs. In wet environments, managing excess water and preventing contaminated discharge is a constant operational challenge. Tailings storage facilities—the largest engineered structures on earth—represent catastrophic failure risks when poorly designed or managed. The Global Industry Standard on Tailings Management (GISTM), developed in response to recent disasters, sets new expectations for design, monitoring, and governance.

### Biodiversity and Land Rehabilitation

Mining inherently disturbs landscapes, removes vegetation, and disrupts ecosystems. The sector's impact on biodiversity is disproportionate to its land footprint because mines are often located in areas of high ecological value—mineral deposits and biodiversity hotspots frequently overlap. Progressive rehabilitation (restoring disturbed land concurrently with active mining) and biodiversity offset strategies are evolving, but the science of ecosystem restoration remains imprecise, and achieving "no net loss" of biodiversity is a contested and technically challenging commitment.

## Regulatory Landscape

Mining regulation is primarily jurisdiction-specific, with significant variation across countries and even within countries. Environmental impact assessment (EIA) requirements, water discharge permits, air quality standards, and mine closure planning regulations exist in most jurisdictions but vary in stringency and enforcement.

The EU's Critical Raw Materials Act aims to secure supply of strategic minerals while establishing sustainability standards. The EU Battery Regulation requires supply chain due diligence for cobalt, lithium, nickel, and other battery materials. The EU Corporate Sustainability Due Diligence Directive imposes human rights and environmental due diligence obligations that directly affect mining supply chains.

In the U.S., the National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA), Clean Water Act, and state-level mining regulations govern mine permitting and operations. The Inflation Reduction Act provides tax incentives for domestic critical mineral production and processing, with environmental review requirements.

Industry-specific frameworks include the International Council on Mining and Metals (ICMM) principles, the Initiative for Responsible Mining Assurance (IRMA), and the Responsible Minerals Initiative (RMI). The Extractive Industries Transparency Initiative (EITI) promotes revenue transparency.

## Opportunities

The critical minerals boom creates a strategic window for mining companies to build new operations to higher sustainability standards from the start. Greenfield mines designed with electrified equipment, renewable energy, dry-stack tailings, and water recycling systems can demonstrate that responsible mining is commercially viable. Companies that establish credibility as sustainable mineral suppliers will command preferential customer relationships and potentially premium pricing.

Operational efficiency gains from electrification are substantial. Battery-electric haul trucks eliminate diesel costs (often the largest single operating expense), reduce ventilation requirements in underground mines, and lower maintenance costs. Renewable energy at mine sites—particularly solar in arid regions—provides energy cost stability in an industry vulnerable to commodity price cycles.

Mine closure and rehabilitation represent an emerging opportunity for companies that approach them strategically. Repurposing mine infrastructure for pumped hydro storage, geothermal energy, or data center cooling can create post-mining revenue streams. Brownfield site redevelopment for renewable energy installations is growing as mines close in regions with strong solar or wind resources.

Our team understands that mining sustainability must balance environmental ambition with operational feasibility, community expectations, and the geological constraints that make every mine unique.

## Frequently Asked Questions

### What is the Global Industry Standard on Tailings Management and is compliance mandatory?

The GISTM was developed by the International Council on Mining and Metals (ICMM), the UN Environment Programme, and Principles for Responsible Investment following the Brumadinho tailings dam disaster. It establishes requirements for tailings facility design, operation, and closure governance, including independent reviews, emergency preparedness, and public disclosure. ICMM members have committed to conformance with GISTM for facilities with "extreme" and "very high" consequence classifications by August 2023, with all facilities by August 2025. While not legally mandated in most jurisdictions, GISTM compliance is increasingly expected by investors, insurers, and customers. Some jurisdictions are incorporating GISTM principles into regulatory requirements.

### How do mining companies address Scope 3 emissions?

For mining companies, Scope 3 emissions are dominated by Category 10 (processing of sold products) and Category 11 (use of sold products)—particularly for fossil fuel producers. For metal and mineral miners, downstream processing emissions are significant. Addressing Scope 3 requires engaging downstream customers on decarbonization, investing in lower-emission processing technologies, and in some cases, vertical integration into cleaner processing. The GHG Protocol's guidance and ICMM's Scope 3 emissions accounting guidance provide sector-specific methodological frameworks. Many mining companies start by reporting Scope 3 and setting engagement targets rather than absolute reduction targets, given limited control over downstream value chains.

### What is IRMA and how does it differ from other mining standards?

The Initiative for Responsible Mining Assurance (IRMA) is a multi-stakeholder standard and independent third-party verification system for mine-site sustainability. Unlike industry-led standards (ICMM), IRMA was co-developed with NGOs, communities, workers, and downstream purchasers. It assesses mine-site performance across four pillars: business integrity, planning for positive legacies, social responsibility, and environmental responsibility. IRMA's independent assessment model—rather than self-assessment—provides higher credibility with downstream purchasers. Apple, Microsoft, BMW, and other major companies reference IRMA in their responsible sourcing programs. Mines can achieve IRMA 50, 75, or 100 certification levels based on performance across 26 requirements.
