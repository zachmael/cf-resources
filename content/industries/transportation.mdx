## Industry Overview

Transportation accounts for approximately 16% of global greenhouse gas emissions and roughly 29% of U.S. emissions—making it the largest emitting sector in the American economy. The sector spans passenger vehicles, freight trucking, rail, aviation, and maritime shipping, each with distinct decarbonization pathways and timelines. Light-duty vehicles are furthest along in the transition, with battery electric vehicles reaching cost parity in several markets. Heavy-duty trucking, aviation, and shipping remain among the hardest sectors to decarbonize.

The transformation underway is reshaping competitive dynamics. Fleet operators face rising fuel costs, tightening emissions standards, and customer demands for low-carbon logistics. Automakers are investing hundreds of billions in electrification. Logistics companies are competing on carbon intensity as shippers incorporate Scope 3 transportation emissions into their sustainability reporting. The companies that master this transition will define the next generation of transportation; those that resist it will be displaced.

The infrastructure challenge is equally significant. Widespread EV adoption requires massive expansion of charging networks, grid capacity upgrades, and new manufacturing supply chains for batteries and components. Freight decarbonization depends on infrastructure that doesn't yet exist at scale—hydrogen refueling stations, electric highway systems, and sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) production capacity. Public and private investment must accelerate dramatically to meet the physical requirements of a decarbonized transportation system.

## Key Sustainability Challenges

### Fleet Electrification at Scale

While light-duty EVs have reached commercial viability, electrifying medium- and heavy-duty fleets remains challenging. Battery weight and volume constraints limit range for long-haul trucking. Charging infrastructure for depot-based fleets requires significant electrical service upgrades. Total cost of ownership is improving but varies by duty cycle, geography, and utility rate structures. Fleet operators must navigate technology uncertainty while making capital commitments with 7-15 year asset lives.

### Sustainable Aviation and Maritime Fuels

Aviation and shipping together account for roughly 5% of global emissions and are among the hardest sectors to decarbonize. Battery-electric flight is viable only for short-range routes. Sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) currently represents less than 0.1% of global jet fuel consumption, constrained by feedstock availability and production costs 2-4x higher than conventional jet fuel. Maritime shipping faces similar challenges, with ammonia, methanol, and hydrogen propulsion all in early development stages.

### Last-Mile Delivery and Urban Logistics

E-commerce growth has dramatically increased last-mile delivery volume, adding trucks and vans to already congested urban areas. Last-mile delivery is the most carbon-intensive leg of the logistics chain on a per-package basis. Solutions include electric delivery vehicles, cargo bikes, micro-fulfillment centers, and route optimization—but implementation requires coordination among shippers, carriers, and municipal authorities.

## Regulatory Landscape

The EU has adopted a ban on new internal combustion engine car sales from 2035 and established CO2 emission standards for heavy-duty vehicles requiring 90% reductions by 2040. The EU Emissions Trading System has been extended to include maritime shipping. The International Maritime Organization (IMO) adopted a revised GHG strategy targeting net-zero shipping emissions by around 2050.

In the U.S., the EPA finalized emissions standards for light-duty vehicles through 2032 that effectively require 56% EV market share. California's Advanced Clean Trucks rule mandates increasing percentages of zero-emission truck sales, with other states adopting similar standards. The Federal Aviation Administration is working with industry on SAF Grand Challenge targets of 3 billion gallons of SAF production by 2030.

The International Civil Aviation Organization's (ICAO) CORSIA program requires airlines to offset growth in international aviation emissions above 2019 levels, with a long-term aspirational goal of net-zero by 2050.

## Opportunities

Fleet electrification offers compelling total cost of ownership advantages in many applications. Electric buses, delivery vans, and short-haul trucks are already cheaper to operate than diesel equivalents when accounting for fuel and maintenance savings. Early movers in fleet electrification lock in energy cost advantages and position themselves for tightening emissions standards.

Carbon-efficient logistics is becoming a competitive differentiator. Shippers increasingly select carriers based on emissions intensity, creating market share opportunities for low-carbon operators. Companies like Amazon, IKEA, and Maersk have set ambitious supply chain decarbonization targets that flow through to carrier selection decisions.

Sustainable fuels represent a growing market. SAF demand is projected to grow from approximately 600 million liters in 2023 to over 30 billion liters by 2030. Companies that secure SAF offtake agreements and develop production capacity are positioning for a market that will be supply-constrained for years.

## How Council Fire Can Help

Council Fire advises transportation companies, fleet operators, logistics providers, and public transit agencies on decarbonization strategy. We develop fleet electrification roadmaps that account for vehicle availability, charging infrastructure, grid capacity, and total cost of ownership. Our team supports emissions measurement and reporting for complex logistics networks, including allocation methodologies for shared transportation and multimodal supply chains.

For ports and maritime operators, we provide guidance on IMO compliance, shore power planning, and terminal decarbonization. For aviation clients, we support SAF procurement strategy and CORSIA compliance. Our work integrates technical feasibility with financial analysis to deliver transition plans that boards and investors can support.

## Frequently Asked Questions

### When will electric trucks be cost-competitive with diesel for long-haul freight?

For short-haul and regional routes (under 200 miles), electric trucks are approaching or have reached TCO parity with diesel in several markets, driven by lower fuel and maintenance costs. Long-haul applications (400+ miles) remain more challenging due to battery weight, range limitations, and charging time. Industry projections suggest TCO parity for long-haul electric trucks by 2028-2030, contingent on battery cost declines and charging infrastructure buildout. Hydrogen fuel cell trucks may serve as a complement for the longest routes, though the refueling infrastructure is even less developed.

### How do we measure and report transportation emissions in a complex supply chain?

Use the Global Logistics Emissions Council (GLEC) Framework, which provides standardized methodologies for calculating logistics emissions across all modes. For Scope 3 reporting, the GHG Protocol's Category 4 (upstream transportation) and Category 9 (downstream transportation) guidance applies. Start by mapping your major trade lanes and transportation modes, apply appropriate emission factors (ideally carrier-specific data, otherwise GLEC default factors), and allocate emissions based on weight, volume, or TEU as appropriate. Software platforms like EcoTransIT, Searoutes, and carrier-provided carbon calculators can automate much of this calculation.

### What is CORSIA and how does it affect airlines?

CORSIA (Carbon Offsetting and Reduction Scheme for International Aviation) is an ICAO program requiring airlines to offset CO2 emissions growth from international flights above 2019 baseline levels. The pilot phase (2024-2026) is voluntary; the first phase (2027-2035) becomes mandatory for flights between participating states. Airlines must monitor and report fuel consumption and emissions, then purchase eligible offset credits or SAF certificates to cover growth above the baseline. CORSIA does not reduce absolute emissions—it offsets growth—but it creates financial incentives for fuel efficiency and SAF adoption.
