## Industry Overview

The built environment is responsible for nearly 40% of global energy-related carbon emissions—split roughly between operational energy use (28%) and embodied carbon in construction materials (11%). Real estate, as the sector that owns, develops, and manages these buildings, sits at the center of the climate challenge. From commercial office towers to residential portfolios, every asset carries an energy profile that directly impacts both planetary outcomes and portfolio value.

The convergence of regulatory pressure, tenant demand, and investor expectations has made sustainability a core consideration in real estate strategy. The EU's Energy Performance of Buildings Directive mandates near-zero energy standards for new construction and phased retrofit requirements for existing stock. In the U.S., cities including New York (Local Law 97), Boston (BERDO 2.0), and Washington, D.C. are imposing building performance standards with escalating penalties for non-compliance.

For institutional real estate investors, ESG performance has moved from a nice-to-have to a fiduciary concern. GRESB participation—the leading ESG benchmark for real assets—has grown to cover over $7.2 trillion in assets under management. Tenants, particularly corporate occupiers, increasingly require green lease provisions and demand LEED, WELL, or BREEAM-certified spaces. The market is pricing sustainability into valuations, and the green premium (or brown discount) is becoming measurable.

## Key Sustainability Challenges

### Decarbonizing Existing Building Stock

New construction can be designed to high-performance standards, but the majority of 2050's building stock already exists today. Retrofitting aging buildings—upgrading HVAC systems, improving envelope performance, electrifying heating—is capital-intensive and operationally disruptive. Many owners face a "split incentive" problem in leased properties: the landlord pays for upgrades, but the tenant captures the energy savings. Solving this requires creative lease structures, green financing, and phased retrofit strategies.

### Climate Physical Risk Exposure

Real estate assets are fixed in place, making them uniquely vulnerable to physical climate risks. Coastal properties face sea-level rise and storm surge. Urban portfolios contend with heat island effects and increasing cooling loads. Wildfire, flooding, and extreme weather events are already affecting insurance availability and pricing in high-risk markets. Portfolio-level climate risk assessment is becoming essential for both regulatory compliance and investment decision-making.

### Data Collection and Benchmarking

Accurate sustainability reporting requires granular data on energy consumption, water use, waste generation, and tenant activity—often across portfolios of hundreds or thousands of assets. Many buildings lack submetering, automated data collection systems, or even consistent utility account structures. Without reliable data, benchmarking performance, identifying retrofit priorities, and meeting disclosure requirements becomes guesswork.

## Regulatory Landscape

Building performance standards (BPS) are proliferating globally. New York's Local Law 97 imposes escalating carbon caps on buildings over 25,000 square feet, with penalties starting in 2024. The EU's EPBD requires all new buildings to be zero-emission by 2030 and mandates energy performance certificates for existing buildings during sale or lease. The UK's Minimum Energy Efficiency Standards (MEES) prohibit leasing of commercial properties below an EPC rating of E, with proposals to raise this to B by 2030.

GRESB reporting, while voluntary, has become a de facto requirement for institutional investors. The Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures (TCFD) framework—now largely subsumed into ISSB standards—requires climate risk and opportunity disclosure that directly impacts real estate valuations and financing terms.

In the United States, the Inflation Reduction Act provides significant incentives for building efficiency, including the 179D tax deduction for energy-efficient commercial buildings (up to $5 per square foot) and 45L credits for residential construction.

## Opportunities

Green buildings command measurable premiums. Research from CBRE and JLL consistently shows 5-15% rental premiums and 10-25% valuation premiums for certified green buildings compared to conventional peers. Occupancy rates tend to be higher, and tenant retention improves in buildings that offer superior indoor environmental quality.

Energy efficiency retrofits, while capital-intensive, often deliver attractive returns. LED lighting, building automation systems, and HVAC optimization typically achieve payback periods of 2-5 years. Deep retrofits involving envelope improvements and electrification carry longer paybacks but position assets for long-term regulatory compliance and value preservation.

Green financing is expanding access to capital. Green bonds, sustainability-linked loans, and Property Assessed Clean Energy (PACE) financing provide favorable terms for qualifying projects. The green mortgage market is also growing, with lenders offering rate discounts for energy-efficient residential properties.

## How Council Fire Can Help

Council Fire partners with real estate owners, developers, and fund managers to integrate sustainability across the asset lifecycle. We conduct portfolio-level carbon assessments, develop decarbonization pathways aligned with science-based targets, and design retrofit strategies that balance environmental ambition with financial returns. Our team supports GRESB reporting, TCFD-aligned climate risk assessments, and compliance with building performance standards across jurisdictions.

For developers, we provide pre-construction sustainability planning that optimizes for certifications, energy performance, and embodied carbon reduction. For asset managers, we build data infrastructure and benchmarking systems that enable informed decision-making across large portfolios. Our work is grounded in the financial realities of real estate—every recommendation carries an investment thesis.

## Frequently Asked Questions

### What is the "brown discount" and how significant is it?

The brown discount refers to the reduction in value that inefficient, high-carbon buildings experience relative to green-certified peers. Research from the University of Cambridge and Maastricht University has documented brown discounts of 10-20% in certain markets, particularly for commercial office properties. As building performance standards tighten and tenant preferences shift, the discount is expected to widen. Properties that fail to meet minimum energy efficiency thresholds may face regulatory obsolescence—inability to lease or sell without significant capital investment.

### How should we prioritize retrofits across a large portfolio?

Start with a data-driven approach: benchmark every asset against relevant performance standards, estimate compliance gaps, and model retrofit costs against avoided penalties and energy savings. Prioritize assets where regulatory deadlines are nearest, where energy intensity is highest relative to peers, and where planned capital expenditure cycles create natural intervention points. Quick wins—LED upgrades, BMS optimization, low-flow water fixtures—should be deployed portfolio-wide while deep retrofits are planned strategically for high-impact assets.

### What is GRESB and do we need to participate?

GRESB (Global Real Estate Sustainability Benchmark) is an investor-driven ESG assessment for real assets. Over 170 institutional investors representing $51 trillion in AUM use GRESB data in their investment decisions. Participation is technically voluntary, but many LPs now require it as a condition of investment. GRESB assesses management practices, performance indicators, and development activities. A strong GRESB score signals operational excellence and ESG maturity to the market. If you are raising institutional capital or managing assets for institutional investors, GRESB participation is effectively mandatory.
