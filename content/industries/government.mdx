## Industry Overview

Government agencies at every level—federal, state, and local—face a dual sustainability mandate. They must decarbonize their own operations (buildings, fleets, procurement) while simultaneously setting and implementing policy that drives economy-wide emissions reductions. This dual role makes government one of the most consequential sectors in the sustainability landscape, yet also one of the most constrained by budgets, political cycles, and institutional inertia.

The scale of government's operational footprint is often underappreciated. The U.S. federal government is the nation's largest energy consumer, largest fleet operator, and largest building owner. State and local governments collectively manage millions of buildings, operate transit systems, maintain water and wastewater infrastructure, and procure hundreds of billions of dollars in goods and services. The purchasing power alone makes government a market-shaping force—when federal procurement shifts toward low-carbon materials, entire supply chains respond.

Climate action at the subnational level has accelerated dramatically. Over 200 U.S. cities have committed to 100% clean energy. States representing over 40% of the U.S. population have adopted economy-wide emissions reduction targets. The C40 Cities Climate Leadership Group connects nearly 100 of the world's largest cities in coordinated climate action. These commitments are translating into concrete programs—building performance standards, fleet electrification mandates, green infrastructure investments—that require technical expertise and strategic planning to implement effectively.

## Key Sustainability Challenges

### Aging Infrastructure and Capital Constraints

Government buildings and infrastructure are often decades old and energy-inefficient. Municipal water systems lose an average of 16% of treated water to leaks. Government fleets include thousands of aging vehicles with limited remaining useful life. Retrofitting this infrastructure requires enormous capital investment at a time when many government budgets are strained. Financing mechanisms like energy savings performance contracts (ESPCs), green bonds, and federal grants can bridge the gap, but require technical capacity to structure and manage.

### Cross-Departmental Coordination

Sustainability in government cuts across every department—facilities, fleet, procurement, planning, public works, finance. Effective climate action requires coordinated strategy and shared accountability, yet government agencies typically operate in silos with separate budgets, systems, and priorities. Establishing governance structures that drive cross-departmental collaboration is a persistent organizational challenge.

### Community Equity and Just Transition

Climate policies disproportionately affect low-income communities and communities of color—whether through energy cost burdens, exposure to pollution, or displacement from green development. Government agencies face growing expectations to center equity in their climate plans, ensuring that sustainability investments benefit all residents and that transition costs don't fall on those least able to bear them. The Justice40 initiative, which directs 40% of federal climate investment benefits to disadvantaged communities, exemplifies this priority.

## Regulatory Landscape

Federal Executive Order 14057 commits the U.S. government to net-zero emissions by 2050, including 100% clean electricity by 2030 and a fully zero-emission vehicle fleet by 2035. The Federal Sustainability Plan provides detailed implementation guidance. The Inflation Reduction Act and Bipartisan Infrastructure Law together provide over $500 billion in climate and infrastructure funding available to government entities.

State-level climate legislation varies widely. California's SB 32 and AB 1279 mandate economy-wide carbon neutrality by 2045. New York's Climate Leadership and Community Protection Act targets 85% emissions reduction by 2050. Colorado, Massachusetts, Maryland, and others have adopted similarly ambitious frameworks. Local governments often operate under state mandates while also setting their own targets.

Internationally, the Paris Agreement drives national government commitments (Nationally Determined Contributions), while frameworks like the Global Covenant of Mayors provide structure for local government climate action. The EU's European Climate Law makes climate neutrality by 2050 legally binding.

## Opportunities

Federal funding for government sustainability has never been more available. The IRA's direct-pay provisions allow tax-exempt government entities to receive cash payments equivalent to clean energy tax credits—fundamentally changing the economics of solar, storage, and efficiency projects for public buildings. The EPA's Greenhouse Gas Reduction Fund provides $27 billion for green financing programs, much of it directed toward community-level projects.

Government procurement represents a massive lever. The Federal Buy Clean Initiative requires low-carbon materials in federally funded construction projects. State and local equivalents are emerging. By incorporating sustainability criteria into procurement—carbon intensity of materials, lifecycle emissions of vehicles, energy performance of equipment—governments can drive market transformation while meeting their own targets.

Climate planning creates economic development opportunities. Communities with proactive climate strategies attract clean energy investment, federal funding, and talent. Climate resilience investments protect public infrastructure and reduce disaster recovery costs. Green infrastructure projects—urban tree canopy, permeable surfaces, bioswales—deliver multiple co-benefits including stormwater management, air quality improvement, and heat island reduction.

## Frequently Asked Questions

### How do we fund sustainability projects with constrained government budgets?

Multiple financing mechanisms exist specifically for government sustainability investments. Energy savings performance contracts (ESPCs) allow agencies to fund efficiency upgrades through guaranteed energy savings with no upfront capital. The IRA's direct-pay provisions make clean energy tax credits available to tax-exempt entities as cash payments. Green bonds and sustainability bonds provide access to capital markets for qualifying projects. PACE financing can fund building improvements repaid through property tax assessments. The key is matching the right financing tool to each project type and structuring programs that minimize budget impact while maximizing long-term savings.

### What should a municipal climate action plan include?

A credible climate action plan should include: a community-wide GHG inventory with clear methodology, science-aligned emissions reduction targets with interim milestones, sector-specific strategies (buildings, transportation, energy, waste, land use), equity analysis and environmental justice provisions, implementation timelines with assigned responsibilities, funding strategies, and monitoring and reporting frameworks. The plan should address both government operations and community-wide emissions, recognizing that government operations typically represent only 3-5% of community emissions. Engage residents, businesses, and community organizations throughout the planning process to build support and identify locally appropriate solutions.

### How does the Justice40 initiative affect climate project planning?

Justice40 directs that 40% of the overall benefits of certain federal investments—including clean energy, energy efficiency, clean transit, and climate resilience—flow to disadvantaged communities as identified by the Climate and Economic Justice Screening Tool (CEJST). For government agencies accessing federal funding, this means project selection and design must consider geographic distribution of benefits, community engagement requirements, and equitable workforce development. In practice, Justice40 requires agencies to map disadvantaged communities in their jurisdiction, prioritize investments that benefit those communities, and track and report benefit distribution. It doesn't prohibit investment in non-disadvantaged areas, but it requires demonstrable equity in overall program design.
