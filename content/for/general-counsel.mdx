## The General Counsel's Sustainability Challenge

ESG litigation is no longer a hypothetical. In 2024 alone, climate-related lawsuits exceeded 2,600 globally, with a sharp increase in cases targeting corporate greenwashing, inadequate climate risk disclosure, and fiduciary duty breaches tied to sustainability commitments. As General Counsel, you're the last line of defense between your organization and regulatory enforcement, shareholder derivative actions, and reputational damage that can erase years of brand equity in a single news cycle.

The regulatory landscape is fragmenting fast. The EU's CSRD imposes mandatory sustainability reporting on thousands of companies—including non-EU companies with significant European revenue. California's SB 253 and SB 261 create disclosure obligations for large companies operating in the state regardless of where they're headquartered. The SEC's climate rules, while subject to ongoing legal challenges, signal a clear direction of travel. Meanwhile, the FTC's updated Green Guides are tightening scrutiny on environmental marketing claims. Your organization is making sustainability claims somewhere—on its website, in investor presentations, in product packaging—and every one of those claims is a potential liability if it can't be substantiated.

The GC's challenge isn't just reactive risk management. It's building a legal infrastructure that allows the business to pursue legitimate sustainability goals without creating exposure. That means reviewing supply chain contracts for ESG compliance clauses, ensuring board-level climate governance meets emerging fiduciary standards, and establishing internal controls that make sustainability disclosures as rigorous as financial ones.

## Key Responsibilities

**Regulatory Compliance Architecture.** Map the full universe of ESG regulations applicable to your organization across all jurisdictions. Build a compliance calendar with filing deadlines, data collection requirements, and internal review processes. This isn't a one-time exercise—new regulations are emerging quarterly.

**Disclosure Review & Liability Management.** Review all sustainability-related disclosures—annual reports, proxy statements, sustainability reports, marketing materials, and investor presentations—for accuracy, consistency, and legal defensibility. Inconsistent claims across documents are plaintiff attorneys' favorite targets.

**Contract & Supply Chain Risk.** Embed ESG compliance requirements in supplier agreements, including audit rights, emissions reporting obligations, and termination clauses for material ESG violations. The EU's Corporate Sustainability Due Diligence Directive (CSDDD) creates direct liability for supply chain human rights and environmental harms.

**Board Governance.** Advise the board on climate governance best practices, including committee oversight structures, director competency requirements, and integration of climate risk into enterprise risk management frameworks.

**Litigation Preparedness.** Develop and maintain a litigation readiness plan for ESG-related claims, including document preservation protocols, expert witness identification, and response playbooks for regulatory inquiries.

## Regulatory Pressure Points

**EU CSRD & CSDDD.** The CSRD requires audited sustainability reports aligned with European Sustainability Reporting Standards. The CSDDD imposes due diligence obligations across value chains for human rights and environmental impacts, with civil liability provisions. Non-compliance can trigger fines of up to 5% of global net turnover.

**SEC Climate Disclosure Rules.** Require registrants to disclose material climate-related risks, governance processes, GHG emissions (Scope 1 and 2), and the financial impact of severe weather events. While legal challenges continue, prudent GCs are preparing as if the rules will survive in modified form.

**California SB 253 (Climate Corporate Data Accountability Act).** Requires companies with annual revenues exceeding $1 billion doing business in California to disclose Scope 1, 2, and 3 emissions annually, with third-party assurance requirements phasing in.

**FTC Green Guides.** The FTC is updating its Guides for the Use of Environmental Marketing Claims. Key areas of scrutiny include "carbon neutral," "net zero," and "sustainable" claims that lack substantiation. Enforcement actions have resulted in multi-million dollar penalties.

**State Attorney General Actions.** Multiple state AGs have opened investigations into corporate greenwashing, particularly in the energy, financial services, and consumer products sectors. These actions often rely on state consumer protection statutes with broad standing provisions.

**Anti-ESG Legislation.** Over 165 anti-ESG bills have been introduced across U.S. state legislatures since 2023. GCs must navigate the tension between voluntary ESG commitments and state laws that restrict consideration of ESG factors in investment, procurement, or lending decisions.

## Quick Wins

1. **Conduct a greenwashing audit.** Review every public sustainability claim your organization has made in the past 12 months—website, annual report, press releases, product labels, social media. Flag any claim that lacks documented, verifiable support. Remediate or remove unsupported claims within 90 days.

2. **Standardize ESG contract language.** Draft template ESG clauses for supplier and vendor agreements covering emissions reporting, human rights due diligence, and compliance with applicable environmental regulations. Roll out with your top 50 suppliers first.

3. **Brief the board on fiduciary duty evolution.** Prepare a 30-minute board presentation on how fiduciary duty is being reinterpreted in the context of climate risk. Reference the *ClientEarth v. Shell* case and recent Delaware Chancery opinions on ESG oversight obligations.

4. **Establish an ESG disclosure committee.** Create a cross-functional review committee—legal, finance, sustainability, investor relations—that reviews all ESG-related disclosures before publication. Model it on your existing disclosure committee for SEC filings.

5. **Map your regulatory exposure.** Build a jurisdiction-by-jurisdiction matrix of ESG regulations applicable to your organization, including effective dates, reporting requirements, and penalty structures. Update it quarterly.

## How Council Fire Can Help

Council Fire partners with legal teams to build ESG compliance programs that withstand regulatory scrutiny and litigation pressure. We help General Counsels map regulatory obligations across jurisdictions, design internal controls for sustainability data integrity, and develop disclosure review protocols that catch inconsistencies before they become liabilities.

Our team has deep experience in CSRD readiness assessments, supply chain due diligence program design, and greenwashing risk audits. We work alongside outside counsel—not as a replacement—to ensure that sustainability programs are built on defensible foundations. We bring the technical sustainability expertise that most law firms lack, translating emissions data, science-based targets, and climate scenarios into language that legal teams can evaluate and boards can govern.

## FAQs

**Is "aspirational" sustainability language legally risky?**
Yes, increasingly so. Courts and regulators are scrutinizing forward-looking sustainability commitments—net zero pledges, carbon neutrality goals, supply chain decarbonization targets—for substantiation. If your organization announces a 2030 emissions reduction target, you need a documented transition plan with interim milestones, allocated capital, and governance oversight. Aspirational language without a credible plan is the textbook definition of greenwashing liability.

**How should we handle anti-ESG legislation in states where we operate?**
Map the specific restrictions in each jurisdiction. Most anti-ESG laws target financial institutions and public pension funds, not operating companies making voluntary sustainability commitments. However, if your organization contracts with state or local governments, procurement restrictions may apply. The key is separating legally protected commercial decisions from politically motivated ESG commitments that could create contractual or regulatory issues.

**Do we need third-party assurance for sustainability reports?**
Under the CSRD, yes—limited assurance is required initially, moving to reasonable assurance over time. Under California SB 253, third-party verification of emissions data is required. Even where not legally mandated, third-party assurance significantly reduces litigation risk by demonstrating good faith and methodological rigor.

**What's the board's liability for climate risk oversight failures?**
Evolving, but directionally clear. The *Caremark* standard requires boards to establish reporting systems for material risks. As climate risk becomes financially material for more companies, failure to implement climate governance structures could support breach of fiduciary duty claims. The safest posture is to integrate climate risk into existing enterprise risk management and document board-level oversight thoroughly.
