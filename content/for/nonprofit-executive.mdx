## The Nonprofit Executive's Sustainability Challenge

Nonprofits occupy a paradoxical position in the sustainability landscape. Many exist specifically to advance environmental or social outcomes, yet few have turned the sustainability lens on their own operations—their facilities, supply chains, investment portfolios, and organizational practices. Meanwhile, funders are increasingly requiring grantees to demonstrate environmental responsibility alongside programmatic impact. The Ford Foundation, MacArthur Foundation, Hewlett Foundation, and dozens of community foundations now ask about organizational sustainability practices in grant applications. If your answer is "we recycle," you're losing competitive ground.

The financial pressure is real. Nonprofits operate on thin margins, and sustainability investments—LED retrofits, fleet electrification, sustainable procurement policies—require upfront capital that competes with programmatic spending. But the cost of inaction is rising faster. Energy costs consumed an average of 6-8% of nonprofit operating budgets in 2024, up from 4-5% five years earlier. Organizations that reduce energy consumption through efficiency improvements free up operating dollars for mission delivery. Those that don't are effectively diverting donor resources to utility companies.

There's also a credibility dimension. Nonprofits that advocate for climate action, environmental justice, or public health while operating out of inefficient buildings, flying staff to conferences without offset programs, or investing endowments in fossil fuel companies face legitimate criticism. Younger staff and board members are increasingly vocal about organizational hypocrisy. Sustainability isn't a distraction from your mission—for most nonprofits, it's a prerequisite for credibly advancing it.

## Key Responsibilities

**Organizational Carbon Footprint.** Measure your organization's greenhouse gas emissions across facilities (Scope 1 and 2), business travel, employee commuting, and purchased goods and services (Scope 3). Establish a baseline and set reduction targets proportional to your organizational capacity.

**Sustainable Operations.** Implement operational sustainability practices: energy efficiency improvements in owned or leased facilities, sustainable procurement policies, waste reduction programs, fleet management strategies, and remote work policies that reduce commuting emissions.

**Endowment & Investment Alignment.** Review endowment and reserve fund investment policies for alignment with organizational mission. Consider ESG-screened investment options, fossil fuel divestment, community development financial institution (CDFI) deposits, and impact investing strategies.

**Funder Reporting & Compliance.** Respond to funder sustainability inquiries with specific, measurable data. Develop a sustainability section for grant applications that demonstrates organizational environmental responsibility alongside programmatic impact.

**Staff Engagement & Culture.** Build internal sustainability culture through staff training, green team formation, sustainability-linked operational policies, and transparent communication about organizational environmental performance. Address climate anxiety as a workforce wellness issue.

**Programmatic Integration.** Evaluate how sustainability intersects with your programmatic mission. For health nonprofits, that's air quality and climate-related health impacts. For education nonprofits, it's climate literacy and green career pathways. For housing nonprofits, it's energy burden reduction and healthy building materials.

## Regulatory Pressure Points

**IRS Form 990 & Governance Expectations.** While Form 990 doesn't currently require environmental disclosures, governance best practices increasingly include sustainability oversight. Charity Navigator and GuideStar ratings factor governance quality, and emerging frameworks may incorporate environmental stewardship metrics.

**State Nonprofit Reporting.** Some states are expanding nonprofit reporting requirements to include environmental practices, particularly for organizations receiving public funds. California, New York, and Massachusetts are leading this trend.

**Funder ESG Requirements.** Major foundations and government agencies are embedding ESG criteria into grant application and reporting processes. The EPA's Environmental Justice Collaborative Problem-Solving program, HUD grants, and Department of Education programs increasingly require grantees to describe environmental practices.

**Building Codes & Energy Benchmarking.** If your nonprofit owns facilities in jurisdictions with building performance standards or benchmarking ordinances (New York, Boston, D.C., Denver), you face the same compliance obligations as commercial building owners. Non-compliance can result in fines and public reporting of violations.

**Endowment Investment Regulations.** The Uniform Prudent Management of Institutional Funds Act (UPMIFA) governs endowment management for most nonprofits. Recent legal interpretations and IRS guidance increasingly support the consideration of ESG factors in investment decisions as consistent with fiduciary duty, particularly when aligned with organizational mission.

## Quick Wins

1. **Conduct an energy audit of your largest facility.** Contact your utility provider—many offer free or subsidized commercial energy audits. Identify the top five energy conservation measures by payback period. Implement no-cost and low-cost measures (thermostat scheduling, lighting controls, plug load management) immediately.

2. **Adopt a sustainable procurement policy.** Draft a one-page policy committing to preferences for recycled content office supplies, ENERGY STAR-rated equipment, sustainable cleaning products, and local food sourcing for events. Circulate it to staff and vendors. This costs nothing and demonstrates organizational commitment.

3. **Review your endowment's fossil fuel exposure.** Request a carbon footprint analysis of your endowment portfolio from your investment manager. If they can't provide one, that's a signal to evaluate managers who can. Consider reallocating 10-25% of reserves to CDFI deposits or ESG-screened funds as a starting point.

4. **Add a sustainability section to your annual report.** Include basic metrics: total energy consumption, business travel emissions, waste diversion rate, and any sustainability initiatives completed during the year. Even rough estimates demonstrate awareness and establish a baseline for improvement.

5. **Apply for energy efficiency incentives.** Nonprofits are eligible for utility rebate programs, state energy efficiency incentives, and the IRA's tax-exempt entity provisions for clean energy investments (direct pay for solar, heat pumps, and energy storage). These programs can fund 30-70% of efficiency improvement costs.

## How Council Fire Can Help

Council Fire works with nonprofit organizations to build sustainability programs that strengthen mission credibility, reduce operating costs, and meet funder expectations. We help nonprofits conduct organizational carbon footprints, develop actionable sustainability plans calibrated to budget constraints, and prepare sustainability narratives for grant applications.

Our team understands the nonprofit operating model—the budget constraints, the competing priorities, the board dynamics, and the staff capacity limitations. We design programs that deliver measurable impact without requiring dedicated sustainability staff or significant capital investment. We also advise nonprofit boards on endowment alignment, helping investment committees navigate the intersection of fiduciary duty, mission consistency, and ESG performance.

## FAQs

**Can we justify sustainability spending when it competes with programmatic budgets?**
Yes, because operational sustainability spending reduces long-term costs, freeing resources for programs. A $15,000 HVAC upgrade that saves $5,000 annually in energy costs pays for itself in three years and generates $5,000/year in perpetual savings for mission delivery. Frame sustainability investments as operational efficiency improvements that increase the percentage of every donated dollar that reaches programs.

**Do funders really care about our organizational sustainability?**
Increasingly, yes. A 2024 survey by the Council on Foundations found that 62% of institutional funders consider organizational sustainability practices in grantmaking decisions. Major funders including Bloomberg Philanthropies, the Bezos Earth Fund, and European foundations have explicit expectations. Even funders that don't formally require sustainability reporting notice when grantees demonstrate environmental leadership—it signals organizational sophistication and values alignment.

**Should our board have a sustainability committee?**
For organizations with budgets above $5 million or those in environment-adjacent mission areas, a board sustainability committee or a sustainability mandate within the governance committee is appropriate. For smaller organizations, integrating sustainability oversight into the finance or operations committee's agenda is sufficient. The key is ensuring board-level visibility and accountability for organizational environmental performance.

**How do we measure our carbon footprint without a sustainability staff person?**
Start simple. Use the EPA's Simplified GHG Emissions Calculator or free tools like CoolClimate Calculator to estimate emissions from electricity, natural gas, fleet vehicles, and business travel. Utility bills provide energy data; expense reports provide travel data. A basic organizational carbon footprint can be completed in 2-3 days of staff time. Council Fire can also conduct the assessment for you and establish a repeatable annual process.
