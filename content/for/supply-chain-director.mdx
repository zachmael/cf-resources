## The Supply Chain Director's Sustainability Challenge

Supply chains have become the frontline of corporate sustainability. The EU's Corporate Sustainability Due Diligence Directive (CSDDD) requires companies to identify and address adverse human rights and environmental impacts throughout their value chains. The EU Deforestation Regulation (EUDR) demands commodity-level traceability to production plots. Scope 3 measurement obligations under CSRD and CDP push emissions accounting deep into procurement relationships. And customers — from major retailers to automotive OEMs — are cascading their own sustainability requirements downward with increasing urgency.

For Supply Chain Directors, this represents a fundamental expansion of the job description. Traditional supply chain management focused on cost, quality, delivery, and risk — with sustainability as an afterthought at best. Now, ESG criteria must be woven into supplier selection, contract negotiation, performance management, and strategic sourcing. The supply chain function owns or influences the data, relationships, and processes that determine whether the organization can meet its sustainability commitments.

The complexity is real: multi-tier visibility is limited, supplier data is inconsistent, and capacity varies enormously across geographies and tiers. But the direction is clear — and organizations that build sustainable supply chain capabilities now will lead on compliance, resilience, and competitive positioning.

## Key Responsibilities

- **Supplier due diligence:** Implement risk-based human rights and environmental due diligence systems meeting CSDDD, LkSG, and equivalent requirements across supplier tiers.

- **Scope 3 data collection:** Drive supplier engagement programs to collect primary emissions data, supporting corporate GHG inventory and science-based target tracking.

- **Commodity traceability:** Build traceability systems for EUDR-regulated commodities and other high-risk materials, from production source to point of import.

- **Sustainable procurement:** Integrate ESG criteria into supplier selection, qualification, performance management, and category strategy.

- **Supply chain resilience:** Assess and mitigate climate-related physical risks to supply chain nodes, logistics routes, and critical materials.

- **Supplier capacity building:** Support strategic suppliers in improving their own sustainability performance through training, technical assistance, and collaborative programs.

- **Grievance mechanisms:** Ensure that workers and communities in the supply chain have access to effective complaints mechanisms as required by CSDDD.

## Regulatory Pressure Points

**CSDDD phased implementation (2027+).** Requires operational due diligence systems — not just policies — covering human rights and environmental impacts across the value chain, including indirect suppliers where risk indicators warrant investigation.

**EUDR enforcement.** Operators placing regulated commodities (palm oil, soy, beef, cocoa, coffee, rubber, timber) on the EU market must provide due diligence statements with geolocation data proving deforestation-free production. Non-compliance triggers market access restrictions.

**Germany's LkSG (Supply Chain Due Diligence Act).** Already in force for companies with 1,000+ employees. Requires risk analysis, preventive measures, corrective actions, and annual reporting on supply chain due diligence.

**Scope 3 reporting under CSRD and SB 253.** CSRD requires disclosure of material Scope 3 emissions; California's SB 253 mandates Scope 3 reporting for large companies. Both depend on supplier data that the supply chain function must collect.

**Uyghur Forced Labor Prevention Act (UFLPA).** Creates a rebuttable presumption that goods from Xinjiang are made with forced labor. Supply chain teams must demonstrate clear traceability and due diligence for goods with any connection to the region.

## Quick Wins

1. **Segment suppliers by ESG risk.** Apply a risk-based approach: categorize suppliers using geographic risk indices, commodity type, and spend volume. Focus deep due diligence on the highest-risk segment (typically 10–20% of suppliers representing 80%+ of risk exposure).

2. **Add ESG criteria to RFPs and contracts.** Require sustainability disclosures (emissions data, certifications, policy commitments) as standard elements in new procurement processes. Include contractual clauses requiring compliance with your code of conduct and cooperation with due diligence activities.

3. **Join industry collaboration platforms.** Leverage existing platforms (EcoVadis, Sedex, CDP Supply Chain, Together for Sustainability) to collect standardized supplier ESG data without reinventing the wheel. These platforms reduce survey fatigue for suppliers who serve multiple customers.

4. **Map Tier 2+ for critical commodities.** For your highest-risk commodity categories, invest in mapping beyond Tier 1. Use bill-of-materials analysis, supplier disclosure requirements, and commodity-flow tracing to extend visibility.

5. **Pilot supplier emissions data collection.** Start with your top 20 suppliers by emissions exposure. Request Scope 1 and 2 data, energy sources, and any product-level carbon footprint information. Use the results to refine your Scope 3 calculation methodology.

## How Council Fire Can Help

Council Fire partners with Supply Chain Directors to build sustainable procurement and due diligence systems that meet regulatory requirements while strengthening supply chain performance. We design risk-based programs that are practical to implement across complex, multi-tier supply networks.

Our expertise spans CSDDD compliance, EUDR traceability, Scope 3 supplier engagement, sustainable procurement strategy, and supply chain climate risk assessment. We help build internal capability through training, process design, and technology selection — ensuring your team can operate the system long after our engagement ends.

## FAQs

**How deep into the supply chain do we need to go?**

CSDDD requires due diligence across the entire value chain, but applies a risk-based approach. You must have systems to assess risk at all tiers and investigate deeper when risk indicators emerge. Practically, focus detailed assessment on Tier 1 and extend to Tier 2+ for high-risk commodities and geographies.

**How do we get suppliers to share emissions data?**

Start with your largest and most strategic suppliers — they're more likely to have the data and more responsive to customer requests. Frame it as a business opportunity (preferred supplier status, long-term contracts) rather than a burden. Provide templates, guidance, and support. Expect 30–50% response rates in year one, improving to 60–80% by year three.

**What tools are available for supply chain sustainability?**

Major platforms include EcoVadis (supplier ESG ratings), Sedex (ethical supply chain data), CDP Supply Chain (climate data), IntegrityNext (compliance monitoring), and specialized traceability platforms for specific commodities. Most offer integration with procurement systems.
