## The COO's Sustainability Challenge

Sustainability targets are set in boardrooms, but they're delivered on factory floors, in distribution centres, and across supply chain networks. The COO is where ambition meets physics — where a net-zero commitment translates into equipment upgrades, process redesigns, energy contracts, and supplier negotiations. Without operational execution, every sustainability strategy is just a document.

The scope of operational sustainability has expanded far beyond energy efficiency programs. COOs now face regulatory requirements for supply chain due diligence (CSDDD, EUDR), operational emissions reporting under CSRD, circular economy mandates, waste reduction targets, and water stewardship obligations. Climate adaptation is increasingly an operational concern as extreme weather disrupts supply chains and threatens facilities.

The COO's unique challenge is balancing sustainability investments against operational performance, cost efficiency, and production continuity. The good news: many sustainability measures — energy efficiency, waste reduction, predictive maintenance, logistics optimization — directly improve operational margins. The harder truth: some structural changes (process electrification, material substitution, fleet conversion) require significant capital and operational disruption before they deliver returns.

## Key Responsibilities

- **Operational decarbonization:** Drive energy efficiency, fuel switching, process electrification, and renewable energy procurement across facilities and fleet.

- **Supply chain management:** Implement sustainability requirements into procurement, supplier selection, logistics, and inventory management — including CSDDD due diligence obligations.

- **Resource efficiency:** Manage water consumption, waste generation, and material flows toward circular economy objectives.

- **Facility and asset management:** Ensure buildings and infrastructure meet evolving energy performance standards and climate resilience requirements.

- **Operational data collection:** Own the primary data sources for Scope 1 and 2 emissions, energy consumption, water, waste, and health & safety metrics — the foundation of sustainability reporting.

- **Business continuity and climate adaptation:** Assess and mitigate physical climate risks to operations, supply chains, and logistics networks.

- **Capital project execution:** Deliver sustainability-related capital investments (solar installations, EV charging, equipment upgrades) on time and on budget.

## Regulatory Pressure Points

**EU Energy Efficiency Directive (EED) recast.** Requires energy audits for large companies and energy management systems for high-consumption enterprises. Sets binding energy efficiency targets that translate into operational requirements.

**EU CSDDD and supply chain obligations.** COOs must ensure that supply chain management systems can identify, assess, and address adverse environmental and human rights impacts — going beyond traditional supplier quality management.

**EUDR commodity traceability.** For companies importing regulated commodities, operations must establish traceability systems from production plot to point of entry, with geolocation documentation.

**National building energy performance standards.** The EU Energy Performance of Buildings Directive (EPBD) recast, along with UK MEES regulations and US local benchmarking laws, impose escalating energy efficiency requirements on commercial and industrial buildings.

**Industrial emissions regulations.** The EU ETS, national carbon pricing mechanisms, and industrial emissions directives create direct cost exposure for operational emissions. CBAM extends this to imported goods.

## Quick Wins

1. **Conduct an energy audit across your top 10 facilities.** Identify the 20% of measures that will deliver 80% of energy savings. Typical payback periods for lighting, HVAC optimization, and compressed air improvements are 1–3 years.

2. **Establish real-time energy monitoring.** Deploy sub-metering and energy management software across major facilities. Real-time visibility typically reduces energy consumption by 5–15% through behavioural changes and anomaly detection alone.

3. **Switch to renewable electricity.** Evaluate green tariffs, power purchase agreements (PPAs), and on-site solar. For many companies, renewable electricity procurement is the single largest lever for Scope 2 reduction.

4. **Launch a supplier sustainability scorecard.** Add ESG criteria to your existing supplier performance management process. Start with your top 50 suppliers by spend — they likely represent 60–80% of your Scope 3 procurement emissions.

5. **Map climate vulnerability for critical facilities.** Screen your top facilities and key supply chain nodes against physical climate risks (flooding, heat stress, water scarcity) using free tools like the World Bank Climate Knowledge Portal or ThinkHazard.

## How Council Fire Can Help

Council Fire supports COOs in translating sustainability commitments into operational reality. We bring deep expertise in operational decarbonization, energy management, supply chain sustainability, and climate adaptation — grounded in an understanding that operational changes must deliver both environmental and business value.

Our team works on the ground with operations, facilities, procurement, and logistics teams to design and implement programs that reduce emissions, improve efficiency, and build resilience. From energy audits and renewable energy procurement strategies to supply chain due diligence systems and circular economy roadmaps, we focus on practical execution that generates measurable results.

## FAQs

**Where do we start with operational decarbonization?**

Start with your energy footprint — it's typically the largest operational emissions source and offers the clearest reduction pathways. Renewable electricity, energy efficiency, and fleet electrification are the foundational moves. Then progress to harder-to-abate areas: process heat, industrial gases, and material-intensive operations.

**How do we balance sustainability investments with operational budgets?**

Many sustainability measures have positive returns within 2–5 years. Frame them as operational efficiency investments, not environmental costs. For larger capital projects (electrification, green hydrogen), use internal carbon pricing to adjust the business case and align with long-term regulatory cost trajectories.

**What operational data do we need for CSRD reporting?**

At minimum: energy consumption by source and facility, Scope 1 and 2 emissions, water withdrawal and discharge, waste generated by type and disposal method, and health and safety metrics. Facility-level granularity is essential for corporate aggregation and assurance.
