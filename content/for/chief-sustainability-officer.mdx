## The CSO's Sustainability Challenge

The Chief Sustainability Officer role has undergone a fundamental transformation. What began as a communications-adjacent position focused on corporate social responsibility reports and philanthropic programs has become a strategic leadership role with direct implications for regulatory compliance, capital access, and enterprise value. CSOs today sit at the intersection of regulation, finance, operations, and reputation — and the expectations from every direction are intensifying.

CSRD alone has elevated sustainability reporting to the same level of rigour as financial reporting, with mandatory assurance and board-level accountability. Add SBTi target commitments, investor engagement on climate transition plans, supply chain due diligence legislation, and biodiversity disclosure frameworks, and the CSO's mandate now spans virtually every function in the organization.

The challenge is not a shortage of frameworks or ambition — it's execution. CSOs must translate complex, overlapping regulatory requirements into coherent organizational programs, secure resources from skeptical budget holders, build data infrastructure that didn't exist five years ago, and deliver measurable results on timelines that leave little room for error. The CSOs who succeed are those who treat sustainability as an enterprise transformation program, not a departmental activity.

## Key Responsibilities

- **Regulatory navigation:** Maintain current expertise across CSRD/ESRS, ISSB, SEC climate rules, CSDDD, EUDR, and national legislation. Determine applicability, assess readiness, and drive compliance programs across the organization.

- **Double materiality assessment:** Lead the process of identifying material sustainability topics from both impact and financial perspectives, integrating stakeholder engagement and embedding results into strategy and disclosure.

- **Climate strategy and target-setting:** Own the development and execution of science-based targets, transition plans, and net-zero roadmaps. Ensure consistency between public commitments and operational reality.

- **ESG data and reporting infrastructure:** Build the data management systems, controls, and governance necessary to produce assurance-ready sustainability disclosures on increasingly compressed timelines.

- **Board and executive engagement:** Translate sustainability complexity into the language of business risk, opportunity, and value creation for board members and C-suite peers who may lack sustainability fluency.

- **Stakeholder management:** Serve as the primary interface with investors, ESG rating agencies, NGOs, regulators, and multi-stakeholder initiatives on sustainability matters.

- **Cross-functional coordination:** Ensure sustainability is integrated into procurement, product development, capital allocation, HR strategy, and enterprise risk management — not siloed in a standalone department.

## Regulatory Pressure Points

**CSRD implementation timelines.** The first wave of reporting began in 2024, with successive waves bringing more companies into scope through 2028. For many CSOs, the timeline to establish compliant reporting processes is already tight, and the transition from limited to reasonable assurance (expected by 2028–2030) adds another layer of preparation.

**SBTi validation scrutiny.** SBTi has tightened its validation criteria, particularly around Scope 3 targets and the use of carbon credits. CSOs must ensure that committed targets are achievable and that progress tracking systems can withstand external review. Reputational damage from missed targets or withdrawn commitments is significant.

**CSDDD obligations.** The due diligence directive requires operational systems for identifying and mitigating adverse human rights and environmental impacts throughout the value chain. For CSOs, this means collaborating with procurement, legal, and operations to build systems that go well beyond disclosure.

**Greenwashing enforcement.** The EU Green Claims Directive, FTC Green Guides revision, and active enforcement by national regulators create real liability for unsubstantiated sustainability claims. CSOs must ensure that every public commitment — from marketing materials to annual reports — is backed by verifiable evidence.

## Quick Wins

1. **Conduct a regulatory applicability assessment.** Map every sustainability regulation and framework relevant to your organization, assess current readiness, and create a consolidated compliance calendar. This provides a clear picture of obligations and helps prioritize resource allocation.

2. **Establish a cross-functional sustainability steering committee.** Bring together finance, operations, procurement, legal, HR, and IT leadership for monthly coordination. This breaks down silos and distributes accountability — the single most important organizational enabler for sustainability execution.

3. **Audit your ESG data pipeline.** Walk through every material datapoint from source to report. Identify where manual processes, missing documentation, or control gaps create assurance risk. Prioritize fixes for the metrics most likely to face scrutiny.

4. **Align investor communications with CSRD disclosures.** Ensure that what you tell investors in roadshows, ESG questionnaires, and annual reports is consistent with what you're preparing for CSRD. Inconsistencies create credibility risk and waste effort.

5. **Build a rolling regulatory horizon scan.** Establish a process (internal or through advisors) to track emerging regulations 12–18 months ahead. Early awareness of incoming requirements avoids the scramble that characterizes too many compliance programs.

## How Council Fire Can Help

Council Fire serves as a strategic partner to CSOs navigating the intersection of regulatory complexity, stakeholder expectations, and organizational transformation. We understand that the CSO role demands both deep technical expertise and the ability to mobilize cross-functional teams around shared objectives.

Our support spans the full CSO agenda: regulatory readiness assessments, double materiality facilitation, CSRD reporting program management, SBTi target development, ESG data architecture design, and assurance preparation. We operate as an extension of your team during critical periods — providing the specialist capacity that internal teams often lack — while building internal capability for long-term independence.

We also help CSOs communicate sustainability strategy to boards and executive teams, translating regulatory requirements and ESG performance into business language that drives resource allocation and strategic commitment.

## FAQs

**How do I prioritize when everything feels urgent?**

Start with compliance deadlines — CSRD reporting dates, SBTi commitment timelines, and regulatory filing requirements. These are non-negotiable. Then prioritize by stakeholder impact: what are your investors, largest customers, and regulators specifically asking for? Build from mandatory obligations outward to strategic ambitions.

**How do I get budget for sustainability infrastructure?**

Frame investments in terms of risk mitigation and cost avoidance. CSRD non-compliance carries legal liability. Assurance findings result in qualified opinions that affect investor confidence. Poor ESG ratings increase cost of capital. Quantify these risks and present sustainability investment as risk management, not discretionary spending.

**Should the CSO report to the CEO or the board?**

Both, ideally. Direct CEO reporting ensures operational integration and strategic alignment. Board-level access — through an ESG or sustainability committee — ensures governance oversight and accountability. The reporting structure matters less than the substance: does the CSO have the authority, access, and resources to drive change?
