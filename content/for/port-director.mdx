## The Port Director's Sustainability Challenge

Ports sit at the nexus of global trade and local environmental impact. The International Maritime Organization (IMO) has committed to net-zero GHG emissions from international shipping by around 2050, with a 30% reduction by 2030 compared to 2008 levels. For Port Directors, this isn't an abstract target—it translates into immediate operational decisions about shore power infrastructure, equipment electrification, fuel bunkering capabilities, and land-use planning for clean energy generation. The ports that invest now will attract the next generation of vessel traffic. Those that don't will watch cargo shift to competitors.

Simultaneously, ports face intense scrutiny from adjacent communities. The American Lung Association consistently ranks port-adjacent neighborhoods among the most polluted in the country. Diesel particulate matter from drayage trucks, cargo handling equipment, and ocean-going vessels contributes to elevated rates of asthma, cardiovascular disease, and premature death. Community advocacy organizations have become sophisticated in their use of air quality monitoring data and regulatory engagement. The South Coast Air Quality Management District, the Port of Long Beach's community advisory committees, and similar bodies nationwide are demanding measurable improvements—not just pledges.

The financial dimension is equally compelling. The EPA's $3 billion Clean Ports Program, funded through the IRA, represents the largest federal investment in port decarbonization in U.S. history. Combined with DOT's RAISE and INFRA grants, DOE's hydrogen hub funding, and state-level programs, Port Directors have access to billions in capital for zero-emission equipment, charging infrastructure, and renewable energy installations. But competition for these funds is fierce, and applications require detailed emissions inventories, environmental justice analyses, and implementation timelines that many port authorities lack the internal capacity to produce.

## Key Responsibilities

**Emissions Inventory & Reduction Planning.** Maintain a comprehensive port-wide emissions inventory covering ocean-going vessels (at berth and in transit), harbor craft, cargo handling equipment, drayage trucks, rail operations, and administrative facilities. Develop reduction pathways aligned with IMO 2030 and 2050 targets.

**Shore Power & Electrification.** Plan and deploy cold ironing (shore power) infrastructure for container, cruise, and tanker berths. Develop charging networks for battery-electric cargo handling equipment, drayage trucks, and yard tractors.

**Alternative Fuel Strategy.** Evaluate and invest in bunkering infrastructure for alternative maritime fuels—LNG as a transitional fuel, green methanol, green ammonia, and green hydrogen. Partner with fuel suppliers and shipping lines to ensure demand-supply alignment.

**Community Health & Environmental Justice.** Engage with port-adjacent communities on air quality monitoring, health impact mitigation, and equitable distribution of clean energy benefits. Design programs that meet Justice40 and EPA environmental justice screening requirements.

**Federal & State Grant Capture.** Lead applications for EPA Clean Ports Program, DOT RAISE/INFRA grants, DOE hydrogen hub funding, and FEMA resilience programs. Manage grant compliance, reporting, and performance metrics post-award.

**Climate Adaptation & Resilience.** Assess port infrastructure vulnerability to sea level rise, storm surge, extreme heat, and changing precipitation patterns. Develop adaptation plans for critical assets including berths, terminals, rail connections, and road access.

## Regulatory Pressure Points

**IMO GHG Strategy (2023 Revision).** Targets net-zero GHG emissions from international shipping by around 2050, with checkpoints of at least 20% reduction by 2030 and 70% by 2040 (compared to 2008). The IMO is developing a global fuel standard and a carbon pricing mechanism expected to take effect by 2027.

**EPA Clean Ports Program.** $3 billion in competitive grants and rebates for zero-emission port equipment and infrastructure. Requires detailed emissions inventories, community benefit plans, and environmental justice analyses. Phased funding through 2027.

**CARB At-Berth Regulation (California).** Requires ocean-going vessels to reduce at-berth auxiliary engine emissions by using shore power, capture-and-control systems, or equivalent technologies. Applies to container, reefer, cruise, and tanker vessels at California ports. Other coastal states are evaluating similar rules.

**CARB Advanced Clean Fleets Rule.** Mandates transition to zero-emission drayage trucks at California ports beginning 2024, with full transition by 2035. Ports nationwide should anticipate similar regulations as other states adopt California's vehicle emission standards under Section 177 of the Clean Air Act.

**EU Emissions Trading System (ETS) for Maritime.** As of 2024, maritime transport is included in the EU ETS. Shipping companies must purchase emissions allowances for voyages to, from, and within the EU. Ports that can offer low-carbon bunkering and shore power become more attractive to carriers seeking to minimize their ETS exposure.

**EPA National Ambient Air Quality Standards (NAAQS).** Port operations contribute to regional attainment status for PM2.5, NOx, and ozone. Non-attainment designations can trigger permitting restrictions and offset requirements that directly affect port expansion plans.

## Quick Wins

1. **Complete a Scope 1-3 emissions inventory.** Use the World Ports Climate Action Program (WPCAP) methodology or GHG Protocol to quantify emissions across all port operations, including tenant activities. This inventory is a prerequisite for virtually every federal grant application.

2. **Deploy shore power at your highest-volume berth.** Start with the berth that handles the most vessel calls annually. A single shore power installation can eliminate 1,000-3,000 tons of CO2e annually while dramatically reducing PM2.5 and NOx exposure for nearby communities.

3. **Establish a community air quality monitoring network.** Partner with local universities or community organizations to deploy PM2.5 and NO2 monitors in port-adjacent neighborhoods. Real-time, publicly accessible data builds trust and provides baseline measurements for demonstrating improvement.

4. **Apply for EPA Clean Ports Program funding.** If you haven't already, submit an application in the current funding round. Priority categories include zero-emission cargo handling equipment, drayage truck charging infrastructure, and shore power installations. Council Fire can support application development.

5. **Join the World Ports Climate Action Program.** WPCAP provides peer learning, technical resources, and credibility with international shipping lines. Membership signals commitment and connects you with ports that have already navigated the challenges you're facing.

## How Council Fire Can Help

Council Fire works with port authorities to build decarbonization strategies that balance emissions reduction with operational performance and financial sustainability. We develop port-wide emissions inventories, design shore power and electrification roadmaps, and prepare competitive federal grant applications—including the EPA Clean Ports Program, DOT RAISE, and DOE hydrogen programs.

Our team understands the operational realities of port environments: berth scheduling constraints, tenant coordination challenges, grid interconnection timelines, and the capital planning cycles that determine what gets built and when. We also bring deep experience in community engagement and environmental justice program design, helping ports build genuine partnerships with adjacent neighborhoods rather than checking compliance boxes.

## FAQs

**How do we fund zero-emission equipment when our capital budget is already committed?**
Layer federal grants with state incentive programs and lease financing. The EPA Clean Ports Program covers up to 100% of eligible costs for zero-emission equipment. California's CORE program offers vouchers for zero-emission trucks and equipment. For non-California ports, DOT RAISE grants can fund infrastructure components. Council Fire helps ports develop blended funding strategies that minimize out-of-pocket capital expenditure.

**What alternative fuel should we invest in for maritime bunkering?**
It depends on your vessel traffic profile. Green methanol is gaining traction for container shipping (Maersk has ordered 25 methanol-capable vessels). LNG serves as a transitional fuel for cruise lines. Green ammonia is the leading candidate for long-haul bulk and tanker routes. Avoid locking into a single fuel—design flexible bunkering infrastructure that can accommodate multiple fuel types as the market matures.

**How do we manage community opposition to port operations?**
Start with transparency. Publish real-time air quality data. Invite community representatives onto advisory committees with genuine decision-making influence—not just comment periods. Fund community health studies independently. The most effective approach is demonstrating measurable air quality improvements through equipment electrification and shore power deployment, then communicating those results in accessible formats.

**Are we liable for tenant emissions?**
Increasingly, yes—at least reputationally and in terms of regulatory compliance. While most port authorities don't directly control tenant equipment, lease agreements can include emissions reduction requirements, equipment standards, and reporting obligations. Leading ports are incorporating zero-emission equipment mandates into new and renewed terminal leases.
