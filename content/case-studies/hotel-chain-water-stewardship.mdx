faqs:
  - question: "Why is water stewardship different from water efficiency?"
    answer: "Water efficiency focuses on using less water within operations. Water stewardship addresses the broader context — the health of the watershed, equitable access, stakeholder engagement, and the company's role in collective water governance."
  - question: "What is Alliance for Water Stewardship certification?"
    answer: "AWS is the leading global standard for responsible water use. It requires sites to understand their water context, engage stakeholders, implement a water stewardship plan, and demonstrate measurable improvement in water governance, balance, quality, and important water-related areas."
  - question: "How do hotels calculate water risk across diverse portfolios?"
    answer: "Tools like WRI Aqueduct and WWF Water Risk Filter assess each property against physical (scarcity, flooding, quality), regulatory, and reputational water risks based on location, enabling portfolio-level risk prioritization."

## Challenge

A hospitality group operating 45 hotels and resorts across the Caribbean, Mediterranean, and southwestern United States was highly exposed to water risk. Twenty-eight of its properties were located in regions classified as "high" or "extremely high" water stress by WRI Aqueduct. The company's water consumption averaged 1,800 liters per guest-night — well above the industry benchmark of 1,200 liters for its property class.

Several factors compounded the risk. Three Caribbean properties relied on desalination, with energy costs representing 35% of total water costs. Two Arizona properties faced mandatory water use restrictions from their municipal water utility. A Mediterranean resort was in a region experiencing its worst drought in 500 years, with local communities visibly resentful of tourism's water consumption while agricultural wells ran dry.

Investor pressure was also mounting. The company's largest institutional investor had flagged water risk as a material ESG concern, and CDP's water security questionnaire — which the company had never completed — was requested by several investors.

## Approach

**Portfolio Water Risk Assessment (Months 1-3)**

We assessed all 45 properties against physical, regulatory, and reputational water risks using WRI Aqueduct, WWF Water Risk Filter, and site-specific regulatory analysis. Each property received a composite water risk score that integrated local water stress, water quality issues, regulatory trajectory, and community sensitivity.

We also conducted detailed water audits at the 12 highest-risk properties, mapping every water use — guest rooms, kitchens, laundry, landscaping, pools, cooling towers, spa facilities — and identifying specific reduction opportunities with payback calculations.

**Water Stewardship Strategy (Months 3-8)**

We developed a three-tier strategy:

*Operational efficiency (all 45 properties):* Low-flow fixtures, smart irrigation controllers, cooling tower optimization, laundry technology upgrades (ozone systems reducing both water and energy), kitchen equipment upgrades, and leak detection systems. Expected portfolio-wide reduction of 25% from baseline.

*Water recycling and reuse (12 highest-risk properties):* Greywater treatment and reuse systems for landscape irrigation, rainwater harvesting where climatically viable, and cooling tower blowdown recovery. Expected additional 10-15% reduction at target properties.

*Watershed engagement (6 flagship properties):* Active participation in local water governance, community water projects (well rehabilitation, school water systems, agricultural water efficiency), and pursuit of AWS certification. This tier addressed the reputational and social license risks that efficiency alone couldn't solve.

**CDP and Investor Reporting (Months 6-12)**

We prepared the company's first CDP water security disclosure, established water KPIs aligned with GRI 303 (Water and Effluents), and developed a water chapter for the company's ESG report. We also prepared investor briefing materials addressing water risk management, including scenario analysis showing potential financial impacts under water scarcity scenarios.

## Results

- **Portfolio water consumption reduced 35%** from 1,800 to 1,170 liters per guest-night over three years — moving below the industry benchmark
- **$4.8 million in annual water and energy cost savings** across the portfolio, driven by efficiency measures (60%), recycling systems (25%), and reduced desalination reliance (15%)
- **AWS certification achieved** at three flagship properties — the first in the company's hospitality segment globally
- **CDP water security score of B** achieved in the first disclosure year
- **Greywater reuse systems** installed at 8 properties, recycling an average of 120,000 liters per day per property for landscape irrigation
- **Community water projects** completed in three destination communities — rehabilitating 12 community wells, installing rainwater harvesting systems at 4 schools, and funding agricultural drip irrigation conversion for 85 small farms
- **Guest satisfaction scores** increased 8% at properties implementing visible sustainability measures, with water stewardship messaging integrated into the guest experience
- **Regulatory risk mitigated** — no properties faced mandatory curtailment during the assessment period, partly because proactive reduction demonstrated good faith to local water authorities
- **Two property acquisitions** evaluated using the water risk assessment framework, with one property rejected due to unacceptable water risk — the first time ESG factors formally influenced an acquisition decision

## Key Takeaways

**Water risk is location-specific.** Portfolio-level water targets are necessary but insufficient. Properties in water-stressed regions need fundamentally different strategies than those in water-abundant areas. The risk assessment must drive differentiated action.

**Stewardship beats efficiency.** Operational efficiency reduces costs and consumption, but in water-stressed communities, it doesn't address the social license risk. Active watershed engagement, community water projects, and transparent governance participation build the relationships that protect the company's long-term ability to operate.

**Make water visible to guests.** Hotels that hide their sustainability efforts miss an opportunity. Properties that integrated water stewardship into the guest experience — explaining local water challenges, showing conservation measures, offering opt-in towel and linen programs with genuine impact data — saw measurable improvements in guest satisfaction and loyalty.

**Integrate water into investment decisions.** The property acquisition that was rejected on water risk grounds represented a meaningful shift in organizational culture — ESG considerations influencing actual capital allocation, not just reporting.
