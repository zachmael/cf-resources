faqs:
  - question: "What is GRESB and why does it matter for REITs?"
    answer: "GRESB (Global Real Estate Sustainability Benchmark) is the dominant ESG benchmark for real estate, used by over 170 institutional investors to assess and compare sustainability performance of property companies and funds."
  - question: "How does climate risk affect commercial real estate valuation?"
    answer: "Physical climate risks (flooding, heat, wildfire) and transition risks (building performance standards, carbon pricing) directly affect property values through insurance costs, capex requirements, occupancy rates, and stranded asset risk."
  - question: "What are green lease clauses?"
    answer: "Green lease provisions create shared obligations between landlord and tenant on sustainability — data sharing, energy efficiency investments, waste reduction, and cost/benefit sharing for green improvements. They solve the split incentive problem where landlords invest but tenants benefit."

## Challenge

A publicly traded REIT with a $8.2 billion portfolio of 120 commercial office and mixed-use properties across 15 metropolitan markets faced escalating ESG demands from institutional investors. Three of its top five shareholders — representing 28% of outstanding shares — had sent letters requesting TCFD-aligned climate risk disclosure, GRESB participation, and science-based emissions reduction targets.

The company had a basic sustainability report covering Scope 1 and 2 emissions for corporate operations but lacked property-level environmental data for most of its portfolio. Utility data was available for only 45 of 120 properties (those with gross leases where the landlord paid utilities directly). The remaining 75 properties had net or modified gross leases where tenants paid utilities, creating a data gap that made portfolio-wide emissions reporting impossible.

Additionally, several major markets were adopting building performance standards — Local Law 97 in New York, BERDO 2.0 in Boston, the Building Emissions Reduction and Disclosure Ordinance in Denver — creating compliance obligations that the company hadn't yet assessed across its portfolio.

## Approach

**Data Infrastructure (Months 1-5)**

We designed and implemented a property-level environmental data management system covering energy consumption, water use, waste generation, and refrigerant management. For gross-leased properties, we established automated utility data feeds. For net-leased properties, we initiated a tenant data collection program using ENERGY STAR Portfolio Manager as the standard platform, supported by green lease amendments that required tenant data sharing.

We set a target of 85% data coverage by floor area within 18 months — an ambitious target given the starting point of 38%.

**Climate Risk Assessment (Months 2-7)**

We conducted a portfolio-wide climate risk assessment aligned with TCFD recommendations. Physical risk analysis covered chronic risks (sea-level rise, extreme heat, water stress) and acute risks (hurricane, wildfire, flood) for each property using peer-reviewed climate models under SSP2-4.5 and SSP5-8.5 scenarios. Transition risk analysis assessed each property against current and anticipated building performance standards, energy code trajectories, carbon pricing scenarios, and tenant demand for green buildings.

The assessment identified 18 properties with material physical climate risk (primarily coastal flooding and wildfire exposure) and 31 properties facing potential non-compliance penalties under building performance standards within five years.

**ESG Integration into Investment Process (Months 4-10)**

We worked with the acquisitions, asset management, and capital planning teams to embed ESG criteria into existing investment processes:

*Acquisitions:* ESG due diligence checklist added to the investment committee approval process, including climate risk screening, building performance standard compliance assessment, ENERGY STAR score, and estimated capex for green building certification.

*Asset management:* Annual property business plans updated to include energy reduction targets, capital improvement plans for building performance standard compliance, and green certification targets.

*Capital planning:* Carbon abatement cost curves developed for each property facing building performance standard compliance, prioritizing investments by cost-effectiveness ($/ton CO2e avoided) and identifying properties where investment couldn't achieve compliance cost-effectively — triggering disposition consideration.

**GRESB and Reporting (Months 8-14)**

We prepared the company's first GRESB submission and redesigned its annual ESG report to align with GRI Standards and TCFD recommendations. The GRESB preparation required not just data but evidence of management systems, policies, stakeholder engagement, and targets — an organizational change effort as much as a reporting exercise.

## Results

- **GRESB 4-star rating** in the first submission year, rising to **5-star** in year two — placing the company in the top 20% of its GRESB peer group
- **Property-level data coverage** reached 88% by floor area within 18 months, up from 38%
- **Portfolio energy intensity reduced 14%** over two years through LED retrofits, HVAC optimization, building automation system upgrades, and tenant engagement
- **31 properties assessed** for building performance standard compliance, with capital plans developed for all — estimated $45 million in total investment to achieve compliance, avoiding projected $12 million in annual penalties
- **TCFD-aligned climate risk report** published, covering physical and transition risks for the full portfolio under two scenarios — the first in the company's GRESB peer group
- **Green lease provisions** adopted in 68% of new leases and renewals, up from 0%
- **Three properties flagged for disposition** based on climate risk and building performance standard non-compliance economics — a first for the company's portfolio management process
- **11 properties achieved ENERGY STAR certification**, up from 2
- **Investor engagement score improved** — all three shareholder letters received responses satisfying their requirements, and the company was included in two ESG-focused real estate investment indices

## Key Takeaways

**Solve the tenant data problem first.** For REITs with significant net-leased space, the tenant utility data gap is the fundamental barrier to ESG progress. Green lease provisions and ENERGY STAR Portfolio Manager adoption need to be priorities from day one.

**Building performance standards create urgency.** BPS compliance requirements are the most tangible, near-term ESG risk for commercial real estate. Companies that assess compliance gaps early can plan capital investments efficiently; those that wait will face compressed timelines and higher costs.

**Integrate ESG into existing investment processes.** Standalone ESG programs that operate parallel to investment decision-making have limited impact. Embedding ESG criteria into acquisitions, asset management, and capital planning ensures sustainability considerations influence actual capital allocation.

**GRESB is a management system, not just a benchmark.** The process of preparing for GRESB forced organizational changes — policies, targets, data systems, stakeholder engagement — that improved sustainability performance independent of the score itself.
