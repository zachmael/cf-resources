faqs:
  - question: "What makes a utility net-zero target credible?"
    answer: "Credibility requires science-based interim targets, detailed resource planning showing how generation mix will change, demand-side strategy, methane leak reduction plan for gas utilities, and transparent treatment of offsets and carbon removal."
  - question: "How do utilities balance decarbonization with rate affordability?"
    answer: "Effective transition plans phase capital investments to match asset retirement schedules, leverage federal incentives (IRA tax credits), prioritize demand-side measures that reduce total system costs, and use regulatory mechanisms like green tariffs to share costs equitably."
  - question: "Should gas utilities plan for full electrification?"
    answer: "Most integrated utilities are planning hybrid scenarios — aggressive building electrification in new construction and at natural replacement points, while maintaining gas infrastructure for industrial process heat and peaking capacity, with increasing renewable natural gas and hydrogen blending over time."

## Challenge

A regional utility serving approximately 1.2 million electric and 800,000 gas customers across three states faced mounting pressure from regulators, institutional investors, and large commercial customers to articulate a credible decarbonization pathway. The company's generation portfolio was 55% natural gas, 25% coal (two remaining plants scheduled for retirement by 2032), 12% nuclear, and 8% renewables. Its gas distribution system represented $6.4 billion in rate base — assets that investors and rating agencies were beginning to scrutinize as potential stranded asset risk.

The company had set a 2050 net-zero target two years earlier, but the announcement lacked a detailed implementation roadmap. Institutional investors holding 35% of outstanding shares had filed a shareholder resolution requesting a Paris-aligned transition plan. Two state public utility commissions had opened proceedings on utility climate planning. And the company's largest industrial customer — a global manufacturer — had informed the utility that it needed renewable energy supply options or would seek alternative providers through retail choice provisions.

## Approach

**Baseline and Scenario Modeling (Months 1-4)**

We built a comprehensive emissions baseline covering Scope 1 (generation and gas distribution), Scope 2 (transmission and distribution losses, facilities), and material Scope 3 categories (fuel supply chain, sold electricity end-use for gas). The gas distribution system's fugitive methane emissions — quantified using a combination of leak survey data, aerial methane detection results, and EPA emission factors — represented a larger share of the carbon footprint than the company had previously reported.

We then developed four transition scenarios ranging from "regulatory compliance minimum" to "accelerated decarbonization" using integrated resource planning models. Each scenario modeled year-by-year changes in generation mix, demand growth (including transportation and building electrification load), grid storage deployment, energy efficiency program impacts, gas system investments, and financial implications including rate impacts, capital requirements, and earnings trajectories.

**Science-Based Target Development (Months 3-7)**

Working within the SBTi framework for electric utilities (SDA approach), we developed interim targets for 2030 and 2035 that aligned with 1.5°C pathways. The target-setting process required careful treatment of the gas business — SBTi's guidance for integrated utilities was still evolving, so we worked with the company and its advisors to develop a methodology for gas distribution emissions reduction that would withstand investor and regulatory scrutiny.

The resulting targets committed the company to a 45% reduction in Scope 1 and 2 emissions intensity by 2030 (from a 2021 baseline) and 70% by 2035, with absolute Scope 3 reduction targets for the gas value chain.

**Integrated Transition Plan (Months 5-12)**

The transition plan covered five workstreams:

*Generation portfolio transformation:* Accelerated coal retirement timeline from 2032 to 2029, enabled by $1.8 billion in IRA tax credits for replacement renewable and storage capacity. New resource additions included 2,400 MW of solar, 800 MW of onshore wind, 1,200 MW of battery storage, and 400 MW of long-duration storage by 2035.

*Gas system decarbonization:* Accelerated pipeline replacement program targeting the highest-emitting vintage cast iron and unprotected steel mains. Renewable natural gas procurement pathway starting at 3% of throughput by 2028 and reaching 15% by 2035. Hydrogen blending pilot program. Strategic assessment of gas system segments facing declining load from electrification.

*Demand-side transformation:* Redesigned energy efficiency programs with increased budgets, new building electrification incentives, managed EV charging programs, and industrial decarbonization advisory services. Projected demand-side measures to avoid 4,800 GWh of annual generation need by 2035.

*Grid modernization:* Distribution system upgrades to accommodate distributed energy resources, advanced metering infrastructure deployment, and grid-edge intelligence platforms to manage bidirectional power flows and flexible loads.

*Just transition and workforce:* Workforce retraining programs for employees at retiring fossil plants, community transition funds for affected communities, and supplier diversity commitments for clean energy procurement.

**Regulatory and Investor Engagement (Months 8-14)**

We supported the company through regulatory filings in all three state jurisdictions, investor presentations, and the formal response to the shareholder resolution. Each audience required different framing — regulators focused on rate impacts and reliability, investors on financial returns and risk management, and the shareholder proponents on ambition and accountability mechanisms.

## Results

- **SBTi-validated near-term targets** approved within 10 months, making the company one of the first integrated utilities in its region with validated science-based targets
- **Coal retirement accelerated by three years**, from 2032 to 2029, enabled by IRA investment tax credits that improved project economics by $340 million
- **3,200 MW of new renewable and storage capacity** approved through integrated resource planning proceedings across three states
- **Methane leak rate reduced 28%** in the first year through accelerated pipeline replacement and enhanced leak detection and repair (LDAR) protocols
- **Shareholder resolution withdrawn** after the company published its transition plan and committed to annual progress reporting against SBTi targets
- **Green tariff program** launched serving 14 large commercial and industrial customers representing 1,100 GWh of annual load
- **Rate impact limited to 2.1% above baseline trajectory** through 2030, offset partially by avoided fuel costs, IRA credits, and demand-side savings
- **Credit rating affirmed** by all three agencies, with the transition plan cited as a positive credit factor in Moody's updated assessment

## Key Takeaways

**Treat the gas business honestly.** Integrated utilities that present net-zero plans without addressing their gas distribution business lose credibility with investors and regulators. The gas system requires its own detailed strategy — not a footnote to the power generation plan.

**Model the financial case rigorously.** The strongest transition plans show year-by-year financial impacts — rate trajectories, capital requirements, earnings implications, and the specific federal incentives that improve economics. Vague statements about "leveraging IRA benefits" don't satisfy investors or regulators.

**Align regulatory strategy with climate strategy.** Each state jurisdiction had different priorities and political dynamics. The transition plan had to flex across regulatory contexts while maintaining a consistent overall narrative and set of commitments.

**Build in accountability mechanisms.** Annual progress reporting against specific interim milestones — not just the 2050 target — was essential for investor credibility and for withdrawing the shareholder resolution.
