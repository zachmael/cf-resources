faqs:
  - question: "What is a regional climate compact?"
    answer: "A formal agreement among diverse stakeholders — typically governments, businesses, universities, and NGOs — to coordinate climate action across jurisdictions and sectors, share resources, align targets, and pursue joint initiatives."
  - question: "How do you align stakeholders with competing interests?"
    answer: "Effective multi-stakeholder processes identify shared interests beneath competing positions, establish governance structures that give all parties voice, create early wins that build trust, and design agreements flexible enough to accommodate different organizational constraints."
  - question: "What makes multi-stakeholder climate initiatives succeed or fail?"
    answer: "Success factors include strong facilitation, dedicated coordination staff, early tangible deliverables, clear governance, and sustained funding. Failure typically results from lack of dedicated coordination capacity, overly ambitious scope, or insufficient attention to power dynamics among participants."

## Challenge

A metropolitan region spanning three counties, 28 municipalities, and a combined population of 1.8 million lacked any coordinated approach to climate action. Individual municipalities had adopted climate plans of varying quality and ambition. The regional chamber of commerce had a nascent sustainability committee. Two universities were conducting climate research without connection to local policy. And several environmental organizations were advocating for aggressive climate targets without engaging the business community or local government pragmatists.

The result was duplication, contradiction, and missed opportunities. Three municipalities independently hired consultants to conduct overlapping vulnerability assessments. A county emissions reduction target conflicted with a neighboring county's economic development strategy. Businesses interested in clean energy procurement couldn't find streamlined pathways across jurisdictional boundaries. And federal grant applications from the region competed with each other rather than presenting a coordinated front.

A community foundation, concerned about the lack of coordination, provided anchor funding for a coalition-building initiative and asked us to facilitate it.

## Approach

**Landscape Assessment and Stakeholder Mapping (Months 1-3)**

We conducted 65 one-on-one interviews with leaders across all sectors — mayors, county executives, business CEOs, university presidents, NGO directors, labor leaders, faith leaders, and community organizers. The interviews assessed each stakeholder's climate priorities, concerns, organizational constraints, and willingness to participate in a regional coalition.

We mapped the stakeholder landscape across two dimensions: level of ambition (how aggressive their climate goals were) and level of pragmatism (how focused they were on implementation feasibility). This mapping revealed four distinct clusters: ambitious advocates (environmental NGOs, some university researchers), pragmatic leaders (several mayors and business leaders with both ambition and implementation focus), cautious participants (most municipal officials, risk-averse businesses), and skeptical observers (some business interests, county officials focused on economic development).

The mapping informed a facilitation strategy that centered the "pragmatic leaders" cluster as the coalition's core, deliberately bringing ambitious advocates and cautious participants into dialogue rather than letting the process be captured by either extreme.

**Coalition Formation (Months 3-8)**

We designed and facilitated a series of structured convenings — starting with small, trust-building conversations among the "pragmatic leaders" and expanding outward:

*Phase 1:* Twelve-person steering committee drawn from the pragmatic leaders cluster — mayors, CEOs, and university leaders who had both ambition and credibility with more cautious stakeholders. Three meetings to establish shared principles and governance norms.

*Phase 2:* Expanded to 35 organizations across four working groups — emissions reduction, climate resilience, workforce transition, and equitable access. Each working group included government, business, NGO, and academic participants.

*Phase 3:* Public engagement through a series of community forums in each county, gathering input from residents, small businesses, and community organizations not represented in the formal coalition.

**Compact Development (Months 6-14)**

The working groups developed specific commitments in their domains:

*Emissions reduction:* Shared regional target of 50% reduction by 2030 (from 2019 baseline), with individual municipality and company commitments that aggregated to the target. A regional clean energy procurement collaborative enabling smaller municipalities and businesses to access competitive renewable energy pricing through pooled demand.

*Climate resilience:* Joint vulnerability assessment methodology adopted by all 28 municipalities, regional infrastructure prioritization, and shared emergency management protocols for climate events crossing jurisdictional boundaries.

*Workforce transition:* Regional clean energy workforce development program linking community colleges, unions, and employers, with commitments from businesses to hire from the program and from municipalities to use project labor agreements on public clean energy projects.

*Equitable access:* Low-income community clean energy access program (community solar, weatherization, EV access), environmental justice screening for all coalition projects, and dedicated seats on the coalition governance structure for environmental justice community representatives.

## Results

- **35-organization climate compact signed** — including 14 municipalities (representing 75% of regional population), 12 businesses, 5 NGOs, and 4 academic institutions
- **Regional emissions target of 50% by 2030** adopted, with individual commitments from signatories aggregating to 52% — exceeding the collective target
- **Clean energy procurement collaborative** launched, aggregating 420 GWh of demand and securing renewable energy pricing 18% below retail rates — savings of $12 million annually for participants
- **$280 million in coordinated climate investment** identified across signatory organizations, including $120M in municipal infrastructure, $95M in business capital investments, and $65M in federal grants where the compact strengthened applications
- **Joint vulnerability assessment** completed across all three counties using consistent methodology, eliminating duplication and providing the first comprehensive regional climate risk picture
- **Workforce program** enrolled 340 participants in its first cohort, with 85% job placement rate in clean energy positions within six months
- **Three federal grant applications** submitted as coordinated regional proposals (rather than competing individual proposals), with two awarded — a combined $48 million in FEMA and DOE funding
- **Community solar program** launched serving 2,400 low-income households with guaranteed savings of at least 15% on electricity bills
- **Annual compact progress report** published with transparent tracking of each signatory's commitments — creating peer accountability that maintained momentum

## Key Takeaways

**Start with trust, not targets.** The one-on-one interviews and small-group conversations that preceded the formal coalition were the most important phase. Stakeholders who'd been talking past each other for years needed facilitated dialogue before they could negotiate shared commitments.

**Center pragmatic leaders.** Coalitions led by the most ambitious voices alienate pragmatists and never achieve the breadth needed for regional impact. Coalitions led by cautious participants set targets too low to matter. Centering pragmatic leaders — ambitious but implementation-focused — produced both ambition and buy-in.

**Create early tangible wins.** The clean energy procurement collaborative delivered measurable savings within months of compact signing. This early win built confidence in the coalition's value and maintained participant engagement through longer-term, slower-moving workstreams.

**Design for accountability without enforcement.** The compact had no legal enforcement mechanism — yet signatories largely met their commitments because the annual progress report created transparent peer accountability. Public commitments with public tracking are surprisingly powerful.
