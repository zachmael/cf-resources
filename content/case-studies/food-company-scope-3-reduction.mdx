faqs:
  - question: "Why is Scope 3 so significant for food companies?"
    answer: "For food distributors and retailers, Scope 3 typically represents 90-95% of total emissions, dominated by purchased goods (agriculture, processing, packaging) and downstream transportation. Ignoring Scope 3 means ignoring the vast majority of climate impact."
  - question: "How do you get suppliers to share emissions data?"
    answer: "Start with your largest suppliers by spend — the top 50-100 typically represent 60-80% of procurement emissions. Use CDP Supply Chain, direct surveys, and industry tools. Provide technical assistance rather than just mandates."
  - question: "What is emissions intensity and why use it instead of absolute emissions?"
    answer: "Emissions intensity measures GHG per unit of output (e.g., kg CO2e per ton of product distributed). It allows growing companies to demonstrate decoupling — reducing the carbon intensity of each unit while the business scales."

## Challenge

A national food distribution company operating 28 distribution centers and serving 45,000 customers across restaurants, hospitals, schools, and grocery chains generated $3.2 billion in annual revenue. The company had measured its Scope 1 and 2 emissions for several years — primarily fleet diesel and warehouse electricity — but had never attempted a Scope 3 inventory.

When a major hospital system customer (representing $180 million in annual contracts) required all suppliers to disclose Scope 3 emissions and set reduction targets as a condition of contract renewal, the company needed to act quickly. A preliminary screening estimated that Scope 3 represented over 93% of total emissions, with purchased goods and services (Category 1) — primarily food products from over 1,200 suppliers — comprising roughly 75% of the total footprint.

The challenge was threefold: measurement (how to quantify emissions across a complex, fragmented supply base), engagement (how to get suppliers ranging from multinational food processors to regional farms to participate), and reduction (how to achieve meaningful cuts in a low-margin business where cost pressures dominate purchasing decisions).

## Approach

**Scope 3 Screening and Prioritization (Months 1-3)**

We conducted a full Scope 3 screening across all fifteen GHG Protocol categories using spend-based emission factors from EEIO databases. This identified the material categories: Category 1 (purchased goods — 75%), Category 4 (upstream transportation — 8%), Category 9 (downstream transportation — 6%), and Category 5 (waste generated in operations — 3%). The remaining categories were individually below 2%.

Within Category 1, we segmented suppliers into tiers based on estimated emissions contribution. The top 80 suppliers by spend represented approximately 65% of Category 1 emissions. The next 200 suppliers represented another 20%. The remaining 900+ suppliers collectively represented 15%.

**Supplier Data Collection (Months 2-8)**

For Tier 1 suppliers (top 80), we launched a direct engagement program. We enrolled the company in CDP Supply Chain and requested disclosure from all Tier 1 suppliers. Simultaneously, we developed a simplified data collection template for suppliers not ready for full CDP disclosure, requesting energy consumption, fuel use, key process emissions, and product-specific allocation data.

For Tier 2 suppliers (next 200), we used a combination of industry-average emission factors from peer-reviewed lifecycle assessment databases and product-category-specific factors from published LCA studies. We supplemented these with a streamlined survey collecting three data points: primary energy source, key production processes, and transportation mode.

For Tier 3 suppliers (remaining 900+), we used EEIO-based estimates refined by product category.

**Hotspot Analysis and Reduction Strategy (Months 6-12)**

The data revealed that five product categories drove over 50% of procurement emissions: beef and dairy (28%), poultry (9%), processed produce (7%), frozen seafood (5%), and bakery/grain products (4%). Within these categories, specific suppliers showed emission intensities 2-4x the category average, indicating significant reduction opportunities.

We developed a reduction strategy with four levers:

*Supplier engagement and technical assistance:* Working with the 30 highest-emitting suppliers to identify reduction opportunities — energy efficiency, renewable energy procurement, process optimization, refrigerant management, and manure management for dairy suppliers.

*Procurement optimization:* Adjusting procurement criteria to favor lower-emission suppliers and products where quality and cost were comparable. This didn't require sacrificing margins — in many cases, more efficient suppliers were also lower-cost.

*Product portfolio analysis:* Providing customers with carbon footprint data by product line, enabling them to make informed substitution choices (e.g., plant-based protein options alongside conventional protein).

*Logistics optimization:* Route optimization, load consolidation, and modal shift from truck to rail for long-haul routes — reducing both cost and emissions in upstream and downstream transportation.

## Results

- **Full Scope 3 inventory completed** covering all 15 GHG Protocol categories, with supplier-specific data for 280 suppliers representing 85% of procurement emissions
- **22% reduction in Scope 3 emissions intensity** (kg CO2e per ton of product distributed) within three years against a 2022 baseline
- **CDP Supply Chain response rate of 72%** from Tier 1 suppliers (above the 65% industry average), with 28 suppliers setting their own SBTi targets as a result of engagement
- **$8.4 million in annual logistics cost savings** from route optimization and modal shift, with corresponding 18% reduction in transportation emissions
- **Customer contract retention rate of 100%** — no contracts lost due to sustainability requirements, and three new hospital system contracts won specifically citing the company's Scope 3 program as a differentiator
- **Five product categories** now offered with verified carbon footprint labels, representing $420 million in annual sales
- **Beef and dairy emissions intensity reduced 15%** through targeted supplier programs including methane digesters at two large dairy operations and improved feed efficiency programs
- **SBTi near-term target submitted** — the first national food distributor in its size category to commit to validated science-based targets covering Scope 3

## Key Takeaways

**Start with spend data, refine with supplier data.** Spend-based Scope 3 estimates are sufficient for identifying hotspots and setting priorities. Don't let the pursuit of perfect supplier data delay action. Improve data quality iteratively as supplier relationships develop.

**Concentrate effort on the vital few.** Eighty suppliers out of 1,200+ represented 65% of procurement emissions. Engaging all 1,200 simultaneously would have been impossible and unnecessary. Focused effort on high-impact suppliers produces faster results.

**Make it a business case, not a compliance exercise.** The suppliers who engaged most actively were those who saw emissions reduction as aligned with operational efficiency and cost reduction. Frame supplier engagement around shared value, not mandates.

**Turn Scope 3 data into a commercial asset.** Customers increasingly want carbon footprint data for their own reporting. Companies that can provide product-level emissions data gain a competitive advantage in procurement decisions — particularly in healthcare, education, and government channels.
