faqs:
  - question: "Why do hospitals need climate risk assessments?"
    answer: "Hospitals face dual exposure — physical risks to facilities (flooding, heat, power disruption) and surging patient demand during climate events. A hospital that loses power or floods during a heat emergency compounds the crisis rather than responding to it."
  - question: "What climate risks are most material for healthcare systems?"
    answer: "Extreme heat (driving patient volume surges), flooding (facility damage and access disruption), power grid instability (threatening life-safety systems), and supply chain disruption (pharmaceutical and medical supply shortages during events)."
  - question: "How does the Health Care Without Harm framework guide hospital climate action?"
    answer: "HCWH's Climate Impact Checkup tool and Race to Zero guidance provide healthcare-specific protocols for emissions measurement, target-setting, and resilience planning aligned with the sector's unique operational requirements."

## Challenge

A regional healthcare system operating 12 hospitals, 45 outpatient facilities, and employing 28,000 staff across a three-state service area had experienced two significant climate-related disruptions in three years. A Category 2 hurricane had forced evacuation of one coastal hospital and caused $23 million in damage. Six months later, an extreme heat event overwhelmed emergency departments across the system, with patient volumes exceeding surge capacity at four facilities.

The system's board directed leadership to assess climate risks comprehensively and develop a resilience investment strategy. The CFO was particularly concerned about insurance implications — the system's property insurance premiums had increased 34% following the hurricane, and its insurer was requesting evidence of climate adaptation investments as a condition of continued coverage.

## Approach

**Physical Risk Assessment (Months 1-5)**

We assessed all 57 facilities against five physical climate hazards: coastal and riverine flooding, extreme heat, severe storms (wind and precipitation), wildfire smoke, and power grid reliability. We used downscaled climate projections under SSP2-4.5 and SSP5-8.5 scenarios through 2050 and 2080, overlaid on facility-specific characteristics including elevation, flood zone designation, building age, critical systems configuration, and backup power capacity.

Each facility received a composite risk score and a detailed risk profile identifying the specific vulnerabilities. We conducted on-site engineering assessments at the eight highest-risk facilities, evaluating structural resilience, mechanical system vulnerabilities, and emergency preparedness gaps.

**Patient Population Vulnerability Analysis (Months 3-6)**

We mapped the system's patient population against climate vulnerability indicators — analyzing the intersection of chronic disease prevalence (cardiovascular, respiratory, renal), social vulnerability (SVI), and projected climate exposure by ZIP code. This analysis identified specific communities within the service area where climate-driven health impacts would create the greatest surge demand, informing both facility capacity planning and community health investment.

**Transition Risk and Opportunity Assessment (Months 4-7)**

We assessed transition risks including building performance standard compliance across jurisdictions, pharmaceutical supply chain climate vulnerability (analyzing the system's top 50 drugs by spend for supply chain climate exposure), energy cost trajectories under carbon pricing scenarios, and regulatory requirements emerging from the SEC climate disclosure rule.

We also identified opportunities: federal funding for healthcare facility resilience, energy efficiency investments with 3-5 year payback periods, renewable energy procurement that reduced both emissions and energy cost volatility, and community health programming that could be funded through Medicaid waiver programs.

**Resilience Investment Plan (Months 6-12)**

We developed a prioritized capital investment plan organized into three tiers: critical (life-safety and regulatory compliance, $65M), high-priority (operational continuity and efficiency, $72M), and strategic (long-term adaptation and community health, $43M).

## Results

- **Comprehensive climate risk assessment** completed for all 57 facilities, the first healthcare-specific TCFD-aligned assessment in the region
- **$180 million resilience investment plan** approved by the board, phased over seven years with clear prioritization criteria
- **Critical infrastructure hardening** completed at 4 highest-risk facilities in year one — elevated electrical switchgear, flood barriers, upgraded backup generators with 96-hour fuel capacity, and redundant communication systems
- **Patient population heat vulnerability map** published and integrated into emergency preparedness protocols, enabling proactive community outreach before heat events
- **Energy efficiency program** launched across all facilities, projecting $14 million in annual savings from LED retrofits, HVAC optimization, and building automation — with a blended 3.2-year payback
- **30 MW solar PPA** executed across six hospital campuses with battery storage, providing both emissions reduction and grid resilience during outages
- **Insurance premium increase limited to 8%** at the next renewal (down from the insurer's initial indication of 22%), with the insurer citing the resilience investment plan as a positive factor
- **Pharmaceutical supply chain assessment** identified three critical single-source drugs with manufacturing concentrated in climate-vulnerable regions, triggering diversification of supply contracts
- **Community health resilience program** launched in four high-vulnerability ZIP codes, including cooling center partnerships, chronic disease management outreach, and a community health worker program focused on heat-related illness prevention

## Key Takeaways

**Healthcare faces compound climate risk.** Hospitals experience both facility risk (infrastructure damage) and demand risk (patient surges) simultaneously during climate events. Planning for only one side of this equation leaves dangerous gaps.

**Connect clinical data to climate projections.** The patient population vulnerability analysis — mapping chronic disease prevalence against climate exposure — produced insights that neither dataset would have yielded alone. It transformed resilience planning from a facilities exercise into a community health strategy.

**Use insurance as a motivator.** The 34% premium increase after the hurricane was a powerful catalyst for board engagement. Demonstrating that resilience investments would moderate future premium increases created a clear financial case that resonated with the CFO and board finance committee.

**Address supply chain vulnerabilities.** Most healthcare systems haven't assessed climate risk in their pharmaceutical and medical supply supply chains. Single-source drugs manufactured in climate-vulnerable regions represent a material risk that's relatively easy to mitigate through supply diversification.
