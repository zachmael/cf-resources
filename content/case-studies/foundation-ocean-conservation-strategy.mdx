faqs:
  - question: "What is a theory of change in conservation philanthropy?"
    answer: "A theory of change articulates the causal logic connecting a foundation's investments to desired conservation outcomes — mapping inputs, activities, outputs, intermediate outcomes, and long-term impact with explicit assumptions that can be tested."
  - question: "How do foundations measure ocean conservation impact?"
    answer: "Common metrics include area under effective protection (not just designated MPAs), fish stock recovery rates, policy adoption milestones, blue carbon sequestration volumes, and community livelihood indicators in coastal zones."
  - question: "What is blue carbon and why does it matter for ocean strategy?"
    answer: "Blue carbon refers to carbon captured and stored by coastal and marine ecosystems — mangroves, seagrasses, and salt marshes. These ecosystems sequester carbon at rates 2-4x higher than terrestrial forests per unit area, making their protection and restoration a high-impact climate strategy."

## Challenge

A private environmental foundation with approximately $200 million in ocean-focused assets under management had been funding marine conservation for over fifteen years. Its portfolio spanned more than 60 active grants across marine protected area (MPA) advocacy, sustainable fisheries, plastic pollution, and marine science. Despite this scale, the foundation's board questioned whether the cumulative investment was producing commensurate impact. An internal review found that many grantees were achieving outputs (reports published, convenings held, campaigns launched) but the connection to measurable conservation outcomes — actual changes in marine ecosystem health, policy adoption, or community livelihoods — was difficult to demonstrate.

The foundation also recognized it was operating in a rapidly shifting landscape. The Kunming-Montreal Global Biodiversity Framework's "30x30" target had created unprecedented political momentum for marine protection. The TNFD framework was bringing nature-related financial disclosures into the corporate mainstream. Blue carbon was emerging as a carbon market opportunity. And yet the foundation's strategy hadn't been substantially updated since 2018.

## Approach

**Portfolio Assessment (Months 1-4)**

We conducted a retrospective analysis of the foundation's ocean grants over the preceding ten years, categorizing each grant by strategic objective, geographic focus, intervention type, and measurable outcomes achieved. We interviewed 35 grantees, reviewed final reports, and mapped the portfolio against global ocean conservation targets.

The analysis revealed several patterns. The portfolio was heavily concentrated in MPA designation advocacy (42% of spending) but underinvested in MPA management effectiveness — a critical gap given that studies show 30-40% of designated MPAs lack adequate management. Fisheries grants were spread across 18 countries with limited strategic coherence. The foundation had no blue carbon investments despite the sector's emergence. And the plastic pollution portfolio, while popular with the public, consumed 15% of the budget with the weakest evidence of systemic impact.

**Theory of Change Development (Months 3-7)**

We facilitated a theory of change process with the foundation's program team, board conservation committee, and a panel of external advisors including marine scientists, fisheries economists, Indigenous marine practitioners, and climate policy experts.

The resulting theory of change organized the foundation's work around three interconnected outcomes: effectively managed marine protected areas covering at least 10 million hectares of high-biodiversity ocean (moving beyond designation to management quality); reformed fisheries governance in 12 priority geographies generating measurable stock recovery and improved coastal livelihoods; and protected and restored blue carbon ecosystems sequestering at least 5 million tonnes of CO2 equivalent annually.

Each outcome pathway specified the intermediate changes needed — policy reforms, institutional capacity, financing mechanisms, community engagement, scientific evidence — and the foundation's comparative advantage in contributing to each.

**Portfolio Restructuring (Months 6-10)**

Based on the theory of change, we recommended significant portfolio rebalancing. MPA funding shifted from designation advocacy toward management effectiveness — supporting ranger training, monitoring technology, sustainable financing mechanisms (like conservation trust funds and blue bonds), and Indigenous-led management models. Fisheries funding consolidated from 18 countries to 8 priority geographies where the foundation could achieve critical mass. A new blue carbon program was established, initially focused on mangrove and seagrass protection in four countries with established carbon market infrastructure. The plastic pollution portfolio was reduced to 5% of spending, focused exclusively on upstream production policy rather than downstream cleanup.

We also recommended the foundation allocate 10% of its portfolio to "frontier bets" — emerging opportunities that didn't fit neatly into the three outcome areas but showed potential for outsized impact, including deep-sea mining governance, marine genetic resources policy, and ocean-climate science.

**Measurement Framework (Months 8-12)**

We designed a measurement framework with leading and lagging indicators for each outcome pathway. Leading indicators tracked grantee capacity, policy progress, and partnership development. Lagging indicators tracked actual conservation outcomes — MPA management effectiveness scores (using the MPA Guide framework), fish stock assessments, blue carbon verification, and community livelihood metrics.

The framework included an explicit learning agenda — questions the foundation wanted to answer through its grantmaking — and annual portfolio review processes that would test and refine the theory of change based on emerging evidence.

## Results

- **Portfolio restructured** from 60+ grants across four loosely defined programs to 38 grants organized around three outcome pathways with clear causal logic
- **$28 million redirected** from lower-impact areas (primarily MPA designation advocacy and plastic cleanup) to MPA management effectiveness and blue carbon — categories with stronger evidence bases for the foundation's comparative advantage
- **Blue carbon program** launched with initial $12 million commitment across four countries, including the first mangrove conservation project to generate verified carbon credits under Verra's VM0033 methodology in one target geography
- **MPA management effectiveness scores** improved measurably at 8 of 12 priority sites within 18 months, measured using standardized METT (Management Effectiveness Tracking Tool) assessments
- **Fisheries governance reform** achieved in 3 of 8 priority geographies within the first year, including adoption of catch documentation and traceability systems
- **Board reporting transformed** from narrative grant summaries to outcome dashboards tracking progress against the theory of change, with quarterly updates and annual deep-dive reviews
- **Leveraged $45 million** in co-funding from three other foundations that aligned their ocean portfolios with the strategy, creating a coordinated funding bloc

## Key Takeaways

**Distinguish outputs from outcomes.** Foundations that track reports published, convenings held, and campaigns launched without connecting these to measurable conservation outcomes will struggle to demonstrate impact regardless of spending levels.

**Consolidate for impact.** Spreading funding across too many geographies and intervention types dilutes influence. The foundation achieved more measurable progress in its first year under the consolidated strategy than in the preceding three years of diffuse grantmaking.

**Invest in management, not just designation.** The ocean conservation community has overinvested in MPA designation relative to management effectiveness. A poorly managed MPA is a paper park — it provides political cover without ecological benefit.

**Build the measurement system alongside the strategy.** Designing the measurement framework concurrently with the strategy ensures that grants are structured to produce measurable evidence from the outset, rather than trying to retrofit evaluation after the fact.
