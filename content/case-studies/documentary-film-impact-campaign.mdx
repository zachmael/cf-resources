faqs:
  - question: "What is an impact campaign in documentary filmmaking?"
    answer: "An impact campaign is a deliberate strategy to use a documentary as a tool for social change — targeting specific policy outcomes, corporate behavior changes, or public awareness shifts through screenings, partnerships, media strategy, and stakeholder engagement coordinated around the film's release."
  - question: "How do you measure the impact of a documentary film?"
    answer: "Impact measurement tracks multiple levels: reach (viewership, media coverage), engagement (event attendance, petition signatures, social media action), attitudinal change (audience surveys pre/post), behavioral change (consumer behavior shifts), and structural change (policy adoption, corporate commitments)."
  - question: "How does Council Fire's work relate to documentary filmmaking?"
    answer: "Council Fire has worked at the intersection of storytelling and environmental strategy — helping filmmakers design impact campaigns, connecting scientific evidence to narrative, and partnering with advocacy organizations to translate public engagement into policy and corporate change."

## Challenge

A production company had completed principal photography on a feature documentary examining the ocean plastic pollution crisis — from microplastic contamination in the deep ocean to the health impacts on coastal communities in Southeast Asia. The film had strong distribution interest (a major streaming platform had offered a global license) and festival buzz, but the filmmakers recognized that distribution alone wouldn't translate awareness into action.

Previous ocean plastic documentaries had generated significant public attention but limited measurable policy or corporate change. The filmmakers wanted this project to be different — to use the film as a strategic tool for specific, measurable outcomes rather than just another awareness exercise.

They came to us to design and execute an impact campaign that would leverage the film's reach to achieve concrete environmental policy and corporate behavior changes.

## Approach

**Impact Strategy Development (Months 1-3, pre-release)**

We began eight months before the film's release date. Working with the filmmakers, we conducted a landscape analysis of the ocean plastic policy environment — identifying which policy changes were politically feasible, which corporate commitments would be most impactful, and which audiences could be mobilized to create pressure.

We defined three measurable impact objectives:

*Policy target:* Passage of extended producer responsibility (EPR) legislation for packaging in at least two U.S. states within 18 months of release. We identified five states where EPR bills were in legislative pipeline and assessed the political dynamics in each.

*Corporate target:* Binding commitments from at least ten major consumer packaged goods companies to reduce virgin plastic packaging by 25% by 2028. We identified 30 target companies and mapped their existing sustainability commitments and vulnerability to public pressure.

*Public engagement target:* Shift measurable public attitudes on plastic pollution from "individual recycling responsibility" to "producer accountability" — measured through pre/post audience surveys.

**Campaign Architecture (Months 3-8)**

We built the campaign around four components:

*Screening and engagement program:* 200+ community screenings in strategic locations — state capitals where legislation was pending, headquarters cities of target companies, university campuses, and environmental justice communities featured in the film. Each screening included post-film panels with local experts, legislators, and affected community members, plus clear calls to action.

*Policy advocacy partnership:* Formal partnerships with three national environmental organizations and twelve state-level advocacy groups, each with specific roles — lobbying, grassroots mobilization, and legal support. We provided each partner with a campaign toolkit including policy briefs, talking points, social media assets, film clips licensed for advocacy use, and data visualizations from the film's research.

*Corporate engagement program:* Direct outreach to target companies combining positive engagement (offering to feature companies that made commitments in campaign communications) and public pressure (organizing shareholder resolutions, social media campaigns, and media coverage targeting companies that refused to engage).

*Media strategy:* Coordinated media plan timed to the streaming release, including op-eds by the filmmakers and scientific advisors in target markets, radio and podcast appearances, social media campaign with the hashtag and challenge format, and journalist briefings with embargoed research data from the film.

**Execution and Measurement (Months 8-20)**

We deployed the campaign in three phases — pre-release (building partnerships and preparing assets), release window (concentrated media and screening activity), and sustained engagement (ongoing policy advocacy and corporate pressure through the legislative sessions following release).

We established a measurement framework tracking reach metrics (viewership, media impressions, social media engagement), engagement metrics (screening attendance, petition signatures, legislator contacts), and outcome metrics (policy votes, corporate commitments, attitude survey results).

## Results

- **28 million viewers** across the streaming platform, broadcast windows, and community screenings within 12 months of release
- **215 community screenings** held across 42 states, with 34,000 in-person attendees and an average post-screening action completion rate of 68%
- **EPR legislation passed in 3 states** (exceeding the target of 2) within 18 months of release — campaign screenings and constituent contacts were cited by legislators as influential factors
- **14 consumer packaged goods companies** made binding plastic reduction commitments (exceeding the target of 10), including four Fortune 500 companies committing to 25-30% virgin plastic reduction by 2028
- **412,000 petition signatures** delivered to the top 10 plastic-producing companies, with significant media coverage of delivery events
- **Attitude shift measured** — post-screening surveys showed a 34-point increase in support for producer responsibility policies (from 38% to 72% agreement) and a 28-point decrease in the belief that individual recycling is sufficient to address plastic pollution
- **$4.2 million in earned media value** generated through 380+ media placements including features in three national newspapers, 12 broadcast segments, and 45 podcast appearances
- **Two shareholder resolutions** filed at target companies that refused direct engagement, with one receiving 38% support — sufficient to force management engagement
- **Impact campaign model documented** and shared with the documentary community as a case study in strategic impact design, influencing the approach of at least six subsequent environmental documentaries
- **Sundance Film Festival** Impact Award nomination, recognizing the campaign's measurable policy outcomes

## Key Takeaways

**Design the campaign before the film is finished.** Starting the impact strategy eight months before release allowed time to build partnerships, prepare assets, and align advocacy timelines with legislative calendars. Films that design impact campaigns after release miss the window of maximum attention.

**Define specific, measurable targets.** "Raising awareness about ocean plastic" is not an impact objective. Passage of EPR legislation in specific states, binding commitments from named companies, and measured attitude shifts are impact objectives. Specificity enables strategy and measurement.

**Pair awareness with infrastructure.** The film created a surge of public concern, but that concern only translated into policy change because advocacy organizations were prepared to channel it — with lobbying campaigns, legislative strategies, and grassroots mobilization already in motion. Awareness without action infrastructure dissipates.

**Films can move markets and legislatures.** The documentary format — personal stories, visual evidence, emotional resonance — creates a form of public pressure that policy briefs and scientific papers cannot. When paired with strategic campaigning, a film becomes one of the most cost-effective tools for environmental policy change.
