faqs:
  - question: "What is a resilience authority and how does it differ from a resilience office?"
    answer: "A resilience authority is a legally independent public entity — similar to a water or transit authority — with its own governance, bonding capacity, and potentially taxing power. This gives it far more implementation capacity than a staff office within county government."
  - question: "How do multi-jurisdictional resilience efforts address local autonomy concerns?"
    answer: "Effective structures preserve municipal authority over local land use and building codes while providing shared services — technical analysis, grant writing, bulk procurement, and infrastructure projects — that no single municipality could afford alone."
  - question: "What funding mechanisms are available for county-level resilience authorities?"
    answer: "Options include dedicated stormwater or resilience fees, special taxing district authority, revenue bonds backed by fee streams, state revolving loan funds, FEMA BRIC and HMGP grants, and HUD CDBG-DR allocations."

## Challenge

A coastal county with 12 incorporated municipalities and a combined population of 420,000 was experiencing the cumulative effects of sea-level rise, intensifying hurricane seasons, chronic stormwater flooding, and saltwater intrusion into its freshwater aquifer. Climate impacts didn't respect municipal boundaries — drainage systems crossed jurisdictions, barrier island management required regional coordination, and the county's sole wastewater treatment plant served eight of twelve municipalities.

Each municipality had adopted some form of climate or sustainability plan, but the plans varied wildly in quality and commitment. The county's three wealthiest municipalities had hired consultants, adopted updated building codes, and begun infrastructure investments. The nine remaining municipalities — including several with significant low-income and minority populations — lacked the staff capacity or budget to move beyond aspiration.

Federal and state resilience funding was increasingly favoring regional, multi-jurisdictional proposals. The county had lost two major FEMA BRIC applications because individual municipal proposals lacked the scale and coordination that reviewers prioritized.

The county commission asked us to design a governance structure that could coordinate resilience efforts regionally while preserving municipal autonomy.

## Approach

**Governance Design (Months 1-6)**

We researched resilience governance models nationally and internationally — including Southeast Florida's Regional Climate Compact, the San Francisco Bay Area's resilience framework, the Netherlands' regional water authorities, and South Carolina's coastal conservancy model. We then conducted 48 interviews with municipal mayors, council members, county commissioners, utility directors, environmental organizations, chambers of commerce, and community groups.

The analysis pointed toward an independent authority model — a public entity established by county ordinance with its own board, executive director, and dedicated funding stream. We designed a governance structure with a 15-member board: one representative from each of the 12 municipalities, plus three county commission appointees representing unincorporated areas and at-large expertise.

The authority would have power to issue revenue bonds, enter interlocal agreements, apply for and administer federal and state grants, and implement regional infrastructure projects. Critically, it would not have authority over local land use or building codes — preserving the municipal autonomy that was a non-negotiable political requirement.

**Funding Mechanism Design (Months 4-9)**

We designed a dedicated resilience fee assessed on all improved parcels in the county, modeled on stormwater utility fee structures. The fee was based on impervious surface area (for stormwater-related resilience) and assessed property value within the floodplain (for flood resilience). We conducted a rate study projecting fee levels sufficient to fund authority operations, provide local match for federal grants, and support a modest annual capital program.

The fee structure included means-tested exemptions for low-income property owners, ensuring the funding mechanism didn't create disproportionate burdens in the communities most vulnerable to climate impacts.

**Regional Vulnerability Assessment (Months 5-12)**

While the governance and funding structures moved through the political process, we conducted the county's first comprehensive, multi-jurisdictional climate vulnerability assessment. Using consistent methodology across all 12 municipalities and unincorporated areas, we modeled exposure to sea-level rise (intermediate and high scenarios through 2100), compound flooding (coincident rainfall and storm surge), extreme heat, and aquifer saltwater intrusion.

The assessment produced a unified risk map and a prioritized project pipeline of 84 infrastructure projects ranked by benefit-cost ratio, equity impact, and co-benefits.

**Launch and Initial Operations (Months 10-18)**

We supported the authority through its political approval process (county commission vote, municipal opt-in agreements), hiring of the executive director and initial staff, establishment of operating procedures, and preparation of the first round of federal grant applications.

## Results

- **Resilience authority established** by unanimous county commission vote, with all 12 municipalities opting in within six months — a remarkable political achievement in a politically diverse county
- **Dedicated resilience fee** generating $14 million annually, providing stable funding independent of annual budget cycles
- **$340 million in infrastructure funding** secured within the first three years through a combination of authority bonds ($120M), FEMA BRIC grants ($85M), state resilience funds ($62M), Army Corps of Engineers projects ($48M), and EPA water infrastructure grants ($25M)
- **Regional stormwater master plan** completed, identifying $520 million in needed improvements with a prioritized 20-year implementation schedule
- **Living shoreline program** protecting 4.2 miles of critical coastline using nature-based solutions — the largest coordinated living shoreline project in the state
- **Unified building code enhancement** adopted by 9 of 12 municipalities, establishing consistent freeboard requirements, stormwater retention standards, and wind resistance specifications
- **Saltwater intrusion monitoring network** deployed with 35 monitoring wells, providing early warning for aquifer management decisions
- **Community resilience hub network** established with 8 facilities across the county, prioritized in environmental justice communities, providing emergency shelter, power, cooling, and communications

## Key Takeaways

**Regional problems need regional governance.** Municipal-level resilience planning in a shared watershed is inherently incomplete. The authority structure enabled infrastructure investments and coordinating mechanisms that no single municipality could have achieved alone.

**Dedicated funding changes everything.** The resilience fee provided stable, predictable revenue that unlocked bond financing, satisfied federal match requirements, and signaled to state and federal funders that the county was serious. Grant applications backed by dedicated local match perform dramatically better than those depending on annual appropriations.

**Equity must be structural, not aspirational.** Building equity into the governance structure (representative board), funding mechanism (means-tested exemptions), and project prioritization criteria (equity-weighted scoring) produced demonstrably more equitable outcomes than voluntary equity commitments.

**Start delivering quickly.** The authority's first visible project — a living shoreline segment in a flood-prone community — was under construction within 10 months of establishment. Early, tangible results built public support and political momentum for larger investments.
