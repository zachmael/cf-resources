faqs:
  - question: "Why is TCFD particularly important for banks?"
    answer: "Banks face climate risk through their lending portfolios — physical risk to collateral, transition risk to borrowers in carbon-intensive sectors, and liability risk from inadequate disclosure. Regulators increasingly expect banks to quantify and manage these exposures."
  - question: "What are climate scenario analyses in banking?"
    answer: "Banks model the impact of different climate scenarios (e.g., orderly transition, disorderly transition, hot house world) on their loan portfolios to estimate potential credit losses, sector concentrations, and stranded asset exposure."
  - question: "How do banks measure financed emissions?"
    answer: "Using the Partnership for Carbon Accounting Financials (PCAF) methodology, banks attribute a share of borrower emissions proportional to their lending exposure, creating a financed emissions inventory that covers their lending and investment portfolios."

## Challenge

A regional bank with $28 billion in total assets, 180 branches, and significant commercial lending concentrations in real estate, agriculture, and energy faced growing expectations for climate risk disclosure. The Federal Reserve's pilot climate scenario analysis, the SEC's climate disclosure rule, and the bank's own institutional investors were all pushing toward TCFD-aligned reporting.

The bank had no climate risk assessment capability. Its enterprise risk management framework treated weather events as operational risk (business continuity) but didn't incorporate climate change as a strategic or credit risk factor. The commercial lending team had no tools for assessing borrower-level climate exposure. And the bank's own operational footprint — 180 branches across a service area spanning coastal, agricultural, and energy-producing regions — had never been assessed for physical climate risk.

The bank's CRO recognized that climate risk was becoming a regulatory expectation and a credit quality issue, but the organization lacked the technical capacity to build a program from scratch.

## Approach

**Governance and Capacity Building (Months 1-3)**

We established a climate risk governance structure: a board-level risk committee charter amendment adding climate risk oversight, a management-level climate risk working group with representatives from risk, lending, treasury, and sustainability, and designation of a climate risk lead within the enterprise risk management function.

We conducted training sessions for the board risk committee, senior management, and credit officers covering climate science fundamentals, regulatory expectations, scenario analysis methodology, and the financial materiality of physical and transition risks specific to the bank's portfolio composition.

**Financed Emissions Inventory (Months 2-6)**

Using the PCAF Standard, we calculated financed emissions for the bank's commercial lending portfolio. We focused on the four highest-emitting sectors by lending exposure: commercial real estate (34% of commercial loans), agriculture (18%), oil and gas (8%), and power generation (5%). For each sector, we used the PCAF-recommended data hierarchy — borrower-reported emissions where available, revenue-based emission factors for most borrowers, and asset-based estimates for real estate.

The inventory revealed that the bank's financed emissions were approximately 4.8 million tCO2e — roughly 200 times its operational (Scope 1 and 2) emissions of 24,000 tCO2e. Oil and gas lending, while only 8% of the commercial portfolio, represented 52% of financed emissions.

**Climate Scenario Analysis (Months 4-9)**

We conducted portfolio-level climate scenario analysis using three NGFS scenarios: Net Zero 2050 (orderly transition), Delayed Transition (disorderly), and Current Policies (hot house world). For each scenario, we modeled:

*Transition risk:* Sector-by-sector credit impact from carbon pricing, technology disruption, and demand shifts — focusing on energy, agriculture, and commercial real estate portfolios. We estimated incremental expected credit losses under each scenario through 2030 and 2050.

*Physical risk:* Property-level analysis of the commercial real estate portfolio (using property addresses from loan files) against flood, wildfire, hurricane, and extreme heat projections. For the agricultural portfolio, we modeled crop yield impacts under temperature and precipitation changes for the bank's primary agricultural lending regions.

The analysis identified meaningful credit risk concentrations: $1.2 billion in commercial real estate exposure in high-physical-risk zones and $840 million in fossil fuel-related lending facing elevated transition risk under orderly transition scenarios.

**Integration and Disclosure (Months 8-14)**

We embedded climate risk indicators into the bank's credit underwriting process — adding physical risk screening to commercial real estate appraisals and transition risk assessment to sector concentration monitoring. We developed the bank's first TCFD-aligned climate risk report as a supplement to the annual report, covering all four TCFD pillars.

## Results

- **First TCFD-aligned climate risk report** published, covering governance, strategy, risk management, and metrics/targets — the first among the bank's regional peer group
- **Financed emissions inventory** completed covering 65% of commercial lending portfolio by value, establishing a baseline for portfolio decarbonization tracking
- **Climate scenario analysis** quantified potential incremental credit losses of $45-180 million across the commercial portfolio under different scenarios — a range that prompted the board to increase loan loss reserves for climate-exposed sectors
- **Credit underwriting enhanced** with physical risk screening for all commercial real estate loans over $5 million and transition risk flags for sector concentrations
- **$1.2 billion in high-physical-risk CRE exposure** identified, triggering enhanced collateral monitoring and insurance verification requirements for affected loans
- **Fossil fuel lending policy** updated to require transition plan disclosure from oil and gas borrowers seeking credit renewal, with declining sector concentration limits
- **Green lending program** launched offering preferential rates for commercial building energy efficiency retrofits, renewable energy projects, and sustainable agriculture practices — originating $142 million in green loans in the first year
- **Regulatory examination** received positive feedback on the bank's climate risk management progress, with examiners noting the bank as a leader among similarly sized institutions

## Key Takeaways

**Financed emissions dwarf operational emissions.** For banks, the loan portfolio is the climate risk — not the bank's own office buildings. Organizations that focus exclusively on Scope 1 and 2 miss 99% of their climate-related financial exposure.

**Scenario analysis reveals concentration risk.** The quantified scenario analysis surfaced credit risk concentrations that traditional sector monitoring hadn't flagged. A $1.2 billion CRE exposure in high-flood-risk areas was a material finding that changed actual risk management behavior.

**Start with available data, improve over time.** The initial financed emissions inventory used PCAF-recommended estimation methods for most borrowers. Perfect borrower-level data would take years to collect. Regulators and investors want to see progress, not perfection.

**Climate risk integration requires training.** Credit officers who've spent careers analyzing financial statements need practical guidance on how climate factors translate to credit risk. Training investment — not just tools — is essential for meaningful integration.
