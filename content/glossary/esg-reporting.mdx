## What is ESG Reporting?

ESG reporting is the practice of measuring, disclosing, and communicating an organization's environmental, social, and governance performance to external stakeholders. It encompasses quantitative metrics (carbon emissions, workforce diversity statistics, board independence ratios) and qualitative disclosures (risk management processes, human rights policies, anti-corruption programs). ESG reporting can be voluntary—through frameworks like GRI, CDP, and SASB—or mandatory under regulations like the EU's Corporate Sustainability Reporting Directive (CSRD) and the SEC's climate disclosure rule.

## Why It Matters

ESG reporting has shifted from a niche corporate responsibility exercise to a core capital markets function. Over 90% of S&P 500 companies now publish sustainability reports, up from roughly 20% in 2011. But the more consequential shift is regulatory: the CSRD brings approximately 50,000 European and non-European companies under mandatory sustainability reporting requirements starting in 2024–2026. The ISSB standards, adopted by jurisdictions from the UK to Japan to Canada, are creating a global baseline for sustainability-related financial disclosures.

Investor demand drives much of this acceleration. Assets under management subject to ESG integration strategies exceeded $30 trillion globally by 2024. BlackRock, State Street, and Vanguard—collectively managing over $20 trillion—routinely engage with portfolio companies on ESG disclosures and vote against directors at companies with inadequate reporting. The data isn't just for annual reports; it feeds quantitative investment models, credit risk assessments, and insurance underwriting.

The quality gap between leaders and laggards creates material consequences. Companies with robust ESG reporting consistently access capital at lower cost—research from MSCI shows a statistically significant relationship between ESG rating improvements and cost of capital reductions of 20–50 basis points. Conversely, ESG data gaps or inconsistencies trigger investor concern, analyst downgrades, and regulatory scrutiny. The EU's CSRD carries penalties for non-compliance comparable to financial reporting violations.

For many organizations, ESG reporting also surfaces operational insights that traditional financial reporting misses. Tracking Scope 3 emissions reveals supply chain dependencies. Measuring employee engagement predicts retention costs. Analyzing water consumption identifies facilities at physical risk from drought. The reporting process itself—when done rigorously—becomes a strategic management tool, not just a compliance burden.

## How It Works / Key Components

ESG reporting follows a cycle: materiality assessment (identifying which topics matter most), data collection and measurement, assurance and verification, disclosure and communication, and stakeholder engagement. The materiality assessment is foundational—it determines reporting scope and prevents the common mistake of disclosing everything superficially rather than focusing on what's decision-useful.

The framework landscape has consolidated significantly. The ISSB (IFRS S1 and S2) provides the global baseline for investor-focused sustainability disclosure. The ESRS under the CSRD provides detailed European requirements with a double materiality approach. GRI remains the most widely used comprehensive reporting framework. SASB (now part of the IFRS Foundation) provides industry-specific metrics. CDP operates the dominant environmental disclosure platform. These frameworks increasingly interoperate—the ISSB and GRI signed a cooperation agreement, and ESRS explicitly maps to GRI.

Data infrastructure is the operational backbone. ESG reporting requires collecting data from across the enterprise—energy bills from facilities teams, supplier surveys from procurement, HR metrics from people systems, governance data from legal. Leading companies implement ESG data management platforms (Watershed, Persefoni, Workiva, Sphera) that automate collection, ensure audit trails, and enable the calculations required for metrics like GHG Protocol Scope 3 emissions. Data quality and internal controls are increasingly subject to the same rigor as financial data, particularly as assurance requirements expand.

Assurance is the frontier. The CSRD mandates limited assurance of sustainability reports from 2024, transitioning to reasonable assurance by 2028. The IAASB published ISSA 5000, the first international standard for sustainability assurance, in 2024. This means ESG data will face independent verification comparable to financial audits—a step change in accountability. Companies need to prepare by implementing internal controls, documentation, and data governance that can withstand external scrutiny.

## Council Fire's Approach

Council Fire helps organizations build ESG reporting programs that satisfy regulatory requirements while generating strategic value. We guide clients through materiality assessments, framework selection, data infrastructure design, and assurance readiness—ensuring that reporting isn't just compliant but produces the insights needed for informed decision-making on climate, social, and governance risks.

## Frequently Asked Questions

### Which ESG reporting framework should my company use?

It depends on your jurisdiction, listing status, and stakeholder priorities. EU-based or EU-revenue-exposed companies must comply with CSRD/ESRS. Companies in ISSB-adopting jurisdictions (UK, Canada, Japan, Australia, and others) should prepare for IFRS S1 and S2. U.S.-listed companies face the SEC climate rule. For voluntary reporting, GRI provides the most comprehensive stakeholder-oriented framework, while CDP is essential for environmental disclosure. Most large companies will need to report under multiple frameworks—interoperability mapping between ESRS, ISSB, and GRI reduces duplication.

### How much does ESG reporting cost?

Costs vary enormously by company size, complexity, and reporting maturity. First-year implementation—including materiality assessment, data system setup, framework gap analysis, and initial report production—typically runs $150,000–$500,000 for mid-cap companies and $500,000–$2 million+ for large multinationals. Ongoing annual costs for data collection, reporting, and limited assurance range from $100,000–$750,000. These costs are declining as technology matures and processes standardize, but assurance requirements will add 30–50% to annual costs for companies not currently obtaining verification.

### What's the biggest mistake companies make in ESG reporting?

Treating it as a communications exercise rather than a data management challenge. Companies that assign ESG reporting to marketing or corporate affairs teams typically produce glossy reports with poor data quality, inconsistent methodologies, and unverifiable claims. When assurance requirements arrive, these organizations face costly remediation. The most effective approach treats ESG data with the same rigor as financial data—defined methodologies, documented processes, internal controls, clear ownership, and audit trails from the start.
