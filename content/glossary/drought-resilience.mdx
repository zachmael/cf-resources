## What is Drought Resilience?

Drought resilience is the capacity of communities, ecosystems, and organizations to anticipate, withstand, and recover from prolonged periods of below-normal precipitation and water availability. It encompasses demand-side measures (conservation, efficiency, reuse), supply-side strategies (diversification, storage, desalination), governance frameworks (allocation rules, drought triggers), and ecosystem management that maintains watershed health. Unlike drought response, which is reactive, drought resilience embeds preparedness into long-term planning and infrastructure design.

## Why It Matters

The World Resources Institute estimates that 25% of the global population—over 2 billion people—faces extremely high water stress annually, and climate change is intensifying drought frequency, severity, and duration across every inhabited continent. The 2020–2023 Western U.S. megadrought was the driest 22-year period in at least 1,200 years according to UCLA paleoclimate research, reducing Lake Mead to 22% capacity and triggering the first-ever federal water shortage declaration on the Colorado River.

Economic damages from drought are staggering but often underestimated because they accumulate gradually. The EU's 2022 drought caused €20 billion in agricultural losses. California's agricultural sector—which produces over a third of U.S. vegetables and two-thirds of fruits and nuts—lost $1.2 billion and fallowed 752,000 acres during the 2021 drought year. The semiconductor industry requires 2–9 million gallons of ultrapure water per day per fabrication plant, making drought a direct threat to global chip supply chains. TSMC in Taiwan faced production risk during the island's 2021 drought.

For investors and corporations, water scarcity is a material financial risk. CDP's 2023 Global Water Report found that companies reporting water-related risks identified $225 billion in potential financial impacts, five times the cost of addressing those risks. Yet 69% of responding companies lacked adequate water management strategies. This gap between recognized risk and implemented resilience represents a governance failure with balance sheet consequences.

Insurance and credit markets are beginning to price drought exposure. Moody's downgraded water utility bonds in drought-affected regions, and agricultural insurers reported record drought-related payouts. Companies dependent on water-intensive operations—food and beverage, mining, power generation, textiles—face mounting pressure from investors, regulators, and communities to demonstrate drought preparedness.

## How It Works / Key Components

Drought resilience strategies operate across three time horizons: immediate response (demand curtailment, emergency supply), medium-term adaptation (infrastructure investment, efficiency upgrades), and long-term transformation (supply portfolio diversification, watershed restoration, land-use change).

On the demand side, proven approaches include tiered water pricing that penalizes excessive use, smart metering and leak detection (utilities globally lose 20–30% of treated water to distribution system leaks), industrial process water recycling, and drought-resistant crop varieties. Israel demonstrates the demand-side frontier—recycling 87% of municipal wastewater for agriculture and achieving per-capita water consumption 50% below the OECD average through pricing, technology, and cultural norms.

Supply diversification is equally critical. Overreliance on a single water source—whether a river basin, aquifer, or snowpack—creates concentration risk. Resilient portfolios combine surface water, groundwater (with sustainable yield management), recycled water, stormwater capture, and where appropriate, desalination. Singapore's "Four National Taps" strategy—imported water, local catchment, reclaimed water (NEWater), and desalination—provides a model of diversified supply architecture for water-stressed regions.

Ecosystem-based approaches recognize that healthy watersheds are water infrastructure. Forest management reduces wildfire risk that degrades water quality and supply. Wetland restoration enhances aquifer recharge. Soil health practices increase water retention capacity by 20,000 gallons per acre per 1% increase in organic matter. These nature-based approaches complement grey infrastructure and often deliver co-benefits for biodiversity and carbon sequestration.

## Council Fire's Approach

Council Fire conducts water risk assessments that map physical scarcity projections against client operational dependencies, regulatory environments, and supply chain water footprints. We develop drought resilience strategies spanning efficiency investments, supply diversification, nature-based watershed management, and governance frameworks—aligned with CDP Water Security disclosure requirements and the CEO Water Mandate's Water Resilience Coalition targets.

## Frequently Asked Questions

### How do companies assess their drought exposure across global operations?

Start with tools like WRI Aqueduct and WWF Water Risk Filter, which provide facility-level baseline water stress, projected future stress, and regulatory/reputational risk scores. Layer this with operational water dependency analysis—how much water each facility requires, what sources it draws from, and what the criticality of water to production is. Then stress-test against climate-adjusted drought scenarios (e.g., a repeat of the worst historical drought under 2°C warming). Companies with high water intensity in high-stress basins need site-specific resilience plans.

### What's the business case for investing in drought resilience before a drought hits?

Proactive investment typically costs one-fifth to one-tenth of reactive emergency response. The California Department of Water Resources estimates that every $1 invested in water use efficiency saves $2.50–$7 in avoided supply costs. Beyond direct savings, drought-resilient operations avoid production curtailments, maintain supplier relationships, reduce insurance costs, and preserve social license to operate in water-stressed communities. Companies that run out of water during a drought face existential operational risk—the Day Zero scenario Cape Town narrowly avoided in 2018.

### How does drought resilience connect to ESG reporting?

Water is a cross-cutting ESG theme. CDP Water Security is the primary disclosure channel, with over 4,100 companies responding in 2023. The CSRD requires water-related disclosures under ESRS E3 (Water and Marine Resources), including water consumption, withdrawal by source, and water stress area operations. SASB includes water management metrics in 20+ industry standards. The Science Based Targets Network is developing water targets that will require companies to set context-based water goals aligned with basin-level sustainability thresholds.
