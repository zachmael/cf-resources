## What is Invasive Species Management?

Invasive species management encompasses the prevention, early detection, containment, control, and eradication of non-native organisms that cause ecological, economic, or human health harm in their introduced range. Invasive species — plants, animals, fungi, and pathogens transported beyond their natural range by human activity — are among the leading drivers of global biodiversity loss, behind only habitat destruction. Management strategies range from border biosecurity and pathway regulation to mechanical removal, biological control, and ecosystem restoration following invasion.

## Why It Matters

The Intergovernmental Science-Policy Platform on Biodiversity and Ecosystem Services (IPBES) published its landmark assessment on invasive alien species in 2023, documenting over 37,000 alien species established worldwide, with more than 3,500 classified as harmful invasives. The economic cost exceeds $423 billion annually and has at least quadrupled every decade since 1970.

Invasive species are implicated in 60% of documented global extinctions and are the leading driver of extinctions on islands. In freshwater systems, introduced species have transformed entire ecosystems — the Nile perch introduction into Lake Victoria caused the extinction of over 200 endemic cichlid species while devastating local fisheries that had sustained communities for generations.

Agricultural losses are enormous. In the US alone, invasive species cause an estimated $120 billion in annual damages across agriculture, forestry, fisheries, and infrastructure. The emerald ash borer, a beetle native to East Asia, has killed hundreds of millions of ash trees since its detection in Michigan in 2002, with projected total costs exceeding $25 billion. Invasive grasses in western US landscapes increase wildfire frequency and intensity, creating cascading costs for fire management, public health, and ecosystem recovery.

Climate change is accelerating invasion dynamics. Warming temperatures expand the potential range of tropical and subtropical invasive species into previously inhospitable latitudes. Disturbance events — storms, droughts, floods — create invasion windows by disrupting native community resistance. The interaction between climate change and biological invasion creates compounding ecological disruption that management frameworks must address simultaneously.

## How It Works / Key Components

Prevention is universally recognized as the most cost-effective management approach. Border biosecurity — inspection of traded goods, ballast water management for shipping, quarantine protocols for agricultural imports — intercepts potential invaders before establishment. The international legal framework includes the Convention on Biological Diversity's Aichi Target 9, WTO Sanitary and Phytosanitary agreements, and the International Plant Protection Convention. Prevention costs a fraction of post-establishment control.

Early detection and rapid response (EDRR) systems form the second line of defense. Citizen science networks, environmental DNA (eDNA) sampling, remote sensing, and machine learning-powered identification tools enable faster detection of new introductions. eDNA is particularly transformative — detecting invasive aquatic species from water samples before populations are visible. Rapid response protocols, pre-authorized by regulatory agencies, allow immediate control action during the narrow window when eradication is still feasible.

Control methods span mechanical (manual removal, trapping), chemical (targeted herbicide or pesticide application), and biological (introduction of natural enemies from the invader's native range). Biological control is the only approach that offers self-sustaining, landscape-scale management, but it requires extensive host-specificity testing to avoid non-target impacts. Successful programs — like the control of prickly pear cactus in Australia using the Cactoblastis moth — demonstrate dramatic results when biological control agents are well-matched.

Eradication is feasible for small, contained populations, particularly on islands. New Zealand's Predator Free 2050 initiative aims to eradicate introduced rats, possums, and stoats from the entire country — the most ambitious invasive species eradication program ever attempted. On smaller islands, eradication of invasive mammals has produced remarkable native species recoveries, demonstrating the conservation return on investment.

## Council Fire's Approach

Council Fire addresses invasive species management within broader biodiversity and ecosystem resilience strategies. We help clients assess invasion risk in supply chains and project footprints, design management programs that integrate with habitat restoration objectives, and navigate the regulatory landscape governing invasive species control across jurisdictions.

## Frequently Asked Questions

### What makes a species "invasive" versus just "non-native"?
Not all non-native species become invasive. A non-native (alien) species is any organism introduced outside its natural range by human activity. An invasive species is a subset of non-native species that establishes, spreads, and causes measurable ecological, economic, or health harm. Most non-native introductions fail to establish, and many established non-natives remain benign. The roughly 10-15% that become invasive cause disproportionate damage.

### Can invasive species ever be fully eradicated?
Eradication is achievable for geographically contained populations, especially on islands. Over 1,500 successful invasive mammal eradications have been documented on islands worldwide. On continents, eradication of widespread invasive species is generally infeasible — management shifts to containment, suppression, and impact reduction. Early detection dramatically increases the probability of successful eradication.

### How does climate change affect invasive species?
Climate change alters invasion dynamics in multiple ways. Range shifts allow warm-adapted invasive species to colonize previously cold regions. Extreme weather events disturb native communities, creating establishment opportunities. Elevated CO₂ benefits many invasive plant species disproportionately. And climate-stressed native ecosystems have reduced resistance to invasion. Management strategies must incorporate climate projections to remain effective under changing conditions.
