## What is Carbon Accounting?

Carbon accounting is the systematic process of measuring, recording, and reporting the greenhouse gas emissions associated with an organization's activities. It encompasses the identification of emissions sources, collection of activity data, application of emissions factors, calculation of total emissions by scope and category, and disclosure of results to stakeholders. The GHG Protocol Corporate Standard provides the foundational methodology used by more than 90% of Fortune 500 companies that report emissions.

## Why It Matters

You cannot manage what you do not measure. Carbon accounting provides the data foundation for every climate-related decision an organization makes—from setting science-based targets to evaluating capital investments, from pricing carbon internally to reporting to regulators. Without accurate emissions data, climate strategies are built on assumptions.

The regulatory mandate for carbon accounting has expanded dramatically. The EU's CSRD requires approximately 50,000 companies to report detailed emissions data starting in 2025-2026. The SEC's climate disclosure rule, the ISSB's IFRS S2, and California's Climate Accountability Package all impose carbon accounting requirements. Companies without mature measurement capabilities face compliance gaps that cannot be closed overnight.

Data quality in carbon accounting directly affects financial outcomes. Sustainability-linked loans and bonds tie interest rates to emissions performance—inaccurate baselines or flawed tracking can trigger covenant violations. Carbon taxes and emissions trading schemes require precise quantification for compliance. Even voluntary commitments, once made publicly, create expectations that demand reliable underlying data.

The complexity of carbon accounting has driven a professional ecosystem. Software platforms (Watershed, Persefoni, Sphera), assurance providers (Big Four firms, specialized verifiers), and consultancies have built practices around helping organizations measure and report emissions accurately. The field is professionalizing rapidly, with dedicated credentials and standards for practitioners.

## How It Works / Key Components

Carbon accounting follows the GHG Protocol's five principles: relevance, completeness, consistency, transparency, and accuracy. Organizations first define their organizational boundary (equity share or operational control approach) and operational boundary (which scopes and categories to include). The inventory must cover all material emissions sources.

Data collection represents the largest operational challenge. Scope 1 requires fuel consumption records, refrigerant purchase and disposal data, and process emissions calculations. Scope 2 requires electricity, heat, and steam consumption data plus grid emissions factors. Scope 3—often 70-90% of total emissions—requires data from suppliers, logistics providers, employees, customers, and end-of-life processors, much of which must be estimated using spend-based or activity-based proxies.

Emissions factors convert activity data into CO₂ equivalent emissions. Sources include the EPA's Emission Factors Hub, DEFRA's Government GHG Conversion Factors, the IEA's emissions factors database, and sector-specific sources like GLEC for logistics. Factor selection significantly impacts results—using supplier-specific factors yields more accurate results than industry averages but requires deeper data partnerships.

Reporting frameworks specify how results are disclosed. The GHG Protocol defines scopes and categories. ISSB and ESRS specify disclosure formats for financial filings. CDP provides a standardized questionnaire for voluntary disclosure. Assurance standards (ISAE 3410, ISO 14064-3) define verification requirements. Leading practice involves limited assurance today, with movement toward reasonable assurance as data systems mature.

## Council Fire's Approach

Council Fire builds carbon accounting systems designed for both compliance and decision-making. We implement measurement frameworks that satisfy regulatory requirements while generating actionable insights for emissions reduction, helping clients move beyond compliance-driven data collection toward strategic carbon management.

## Frequently Asked Questions

### What is the difference between carbon accounting and carbon footprinting?
Carbon footprinting typically refers to a one-time calculation of an organization's or product's total emissions. Carbon accounting is the ongoing, systematic process of measuring, tracking, and reporting emissions over time, including governance, data management, and verification.

### How accurate does carbon accounting need to be?
Regulatory standards typically require that inventories are "materially correct" and that uncertainties are documented and minimized over time. Scope 1 and 2 data can often achieve ±5-10% accuracy. Scope 3, given its reliance on estimates and proxies, may initially have ±30-50% uncertainty, with improvement expected as supplier-specific data improves.

### What software is used for carbon accounting?
Leading platforms include Watershed, Persefoni, Sphera, SAP Sustainability Control Tower, and Salesforce Net Zero Cloud. The choice depends on company size, complexity, existing IT infrastructure, and reporting requirements. Many organizations start with spreadsheets before graduating to dedicated platforms.
