## What is Sustainability Accounting?

Sustainability accounting is the practice of measuring, recording, and reporting an organization's environmental, social, and governance performance using structured methodologies comparable to financial accounting. It applies accounting principles—consistency, comparability, reliability, and relevance—to non-financial data, enabling organizations and their stakeholders to evaluate sustainability performance with rigor historically reserved for financial results.

## Why It Matters

The Sustainability Accounting Standards Board (SASB), founded in 2011 and now consolidated under the IFRS Foundation alongside the ISSB, pioneered the concept that sustainability information should be reported with accounting-level discipline. SASB developed industry-specific standards for 77 industries, identifying the minimum set of financially material sustainability topics and associated metrics for each. This specificity—telling a semiconductor company exactly which water metrics to report and a bank exactly which financial inclusion metrics matter—addressed the comparability problem that plagued voluntary ESG reporting.

The integration of SASB into the ISSB means sustainability accounting principles now underpin global baseline standards. IFRS S1 and S2 draw directly on SASB's industry-based approach, and the ISSB has adopted SASB standards as the starting point for industry-specific guidance. Companies already reporting under SASB have a head start on ISSB compliance.

For CFOs and controllers, sustainability accounting represents the inevitable extension of their domain. As ESG data becomes subject to assurance, digital tagging, and regulatory filing requirements, the accounting function must expand to encompass sustainability metrics. This isn't about sustainability teams learning accounting—it's about accounting teams learning sustainability, and about building the controls, processes, and documentation standards that make ESG data as reliable as financial data.

The market is rewarding this integration. A 2023 Harvard Business School study found that companies reporting on SASB-identified material topics generated superior risk-adjusted returns compared to those reporting on immaterial topics or not reporting at all. This suggests that structured sustainability accounting doesn't just satisfy disclosure requirements—it focuses management attention on the ESG factors that actually drive financial performance.

## How It Works / Key Components

**Industry-specific metric identification** selects the sustainability metrics most relevant to the organization's sector. SASB standards define between 5 and 26 disclosure topics per industry, each with specific quantitative and qualitative metrics. For example, SASB's standard for the oil and gas exploration and production industry includes greenhouse gas emissions (with specific metrics like gross Scope 1 emissions and flaring rates), water management (volumes withdrawn and recycled in water-stressed areas), and community relations (reserves in or near indigenous land).

**Measurement methodology and boundaries** establishes how metrics are calculated and what's included. This mirrors financial accounting's approach to recognition and measurement. For emissions, the GHG Protocol defines the methodology; for water, the CEO Water Mandate provides guidance; for social metrics, measurement standards are less mature but evolving. Boundary questions—which entities, operations, and value chain segments are included—must be defined consistently and disclosed transparently.

**Internal controls and assurance readiness** applies financial accounting control principles to sustainability data. This includes segregation of duties (the person entering data shouldn't approve it), automated validation checks, documentation of estimation methods and assumptions, and periodic reconciliation of ESG data to source records. These controls form the basis for both internal and external assurance.

**Reporting and disclosure** presents sustainability accounting information in formats that serve different audiences. Investor-oriented disclosures align with SASB/ISSB formats. Regulatory filings follow ESRS or jurisdictional requirements. Management reports may include additional operational detail. The underlying data architecture should support all these outputs from a single source of truth.

## Council Fire's Approach

Council Fire helps organizations build sustainability accounting capabilities that integrate with existing financial processes. We map applicable SASB and ISSB metrics to current data infrastructure, identify measurement gaps, design controls and documentation standards, and train accounting and sustainability teams to work together—ensuring that ESG data achieves the same reliability standards as financial data.

## Frequently Asked Questions

### What's the difference between sustainability accounting and ESG reporting?
Sustainability accounting is a discipline—the practice of measuring and recording ESG performance with accounting-level rigor. ESG reporting is the communication of that information to external audiences. You can do ESG reporting without sustainability accounting (many companies do, using ad-hoc data collection), but the result is often unreliable and non-comparable data. Sustainability accounting provides the foundation that makes ESG reporting credible.

### Are SASB standards still relevant now that the ISSB exists?
Yes. The ISSB has explicitly adopted SASB standards as the basis for its industry-specific guidance. IFRS S1 directs companies to consider SASB standards when identifying sustainability-related risks, opportunities, and associated metrics. Companies reporting under ISSB are expected to use SASB's industry-specific metrics unless they can justify more relevant alternatives. SASB standards are being maintained and updated under the ISSB's oversight.

### How do you handle sustainability metrics that don't have established measurement standards?
This is particularly common for social and governance metrics. The approach involves: selecting the most widely accepted methodology available (even if imperfect), documenting the methodology chosen and the rationale, applying it consistently across reporting periods, disclosing any limitations, and monitoring standard development for future adoption. Consistency over time is often more valuable than methodological perfection in any single period.
