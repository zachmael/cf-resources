## What is Electrification?

Electrification is the process of replacing technologies that burn fossil fuels directly—vehicles with internal combustion engines, gas-fired furnaces, diesel industrial equipment—with electric alternatives powered by the grid. As the electricity grid itself becomes cleaner through renewable energy deployment, electrification converts fossil fuel demand into clean electricity demand, achieving emissions reductions at the point of use.

## Why It Matters

Approximately 80% of global final energy consumption still comes from direct combustion of fossil fuels. Electrification is the single most impactful lever for reducing this dependence, because electric technologies are inherently more efficient than combustion—a heat pump delivers 3-4 units of heat per unit of electricity consumed, compared to a gas furnace's 0.9 units per unit of fuel burned. An electric motor converts over 90% of electrical energy to motion, versus 25-30% for an internal combustion engine.

The economics have shifted decisively. Electric vehicle total cost of ownership is now competitive with or below ICE vehicles in most passenger segments across Europe and China, and approaching parity in North America. Commercial heat pumps deliver lower lifecycle costs than gas boilers in most climates when considering equipment, energy, and maintenance. Industrial electric boilers and induction furnaces are increasingly competitive for low- and medium-temperature heat applications.

Global EV sales surpassed 17 million units in 2024, representing over 18% of new car sales. The European Union will ban new ICE vehicle sales from 2035. Heat pump installations across Europe exceeded 3 million units in 2023, supported by REPowerEU policy incentives. These are not marginal trends—they represent structural shifts in major capital goods markets.

For businesses, electrification reduces direct (Scope 1) emissions from on-site combustion and shifts energy costs from volatile commodity fuel prices to more predictable electricity rates. Combined with renewable energy procurement, electrification can eliminate a significant portion of a company's carbon footprint while reducing long-term energy cost risk.

## How It Works / Key Components

Transportation electrification replaces ICE vehicles with battery electric vehicles (BEVs) across passenger cars, light commercial vehicles, buses, and increasingly medium- and heavy-duty trucks. Charging infrastructure—Level 2 for overnight/workplace charging, DC fast charging for en-route needs—is the critical enabler. Fleet operators face decisions around vehicle selection, charging depot design, grid connection upgrades, and fleet management software that optimizes charging around electricity prices and grid constraints.

Building electrification centers on replacing gas and oil heating systems with electric heat pumps, converting gas stoves to induction cooktops, and installing electric water heaters. For commercial buildings, this often involves comprehensive retrofits coordinated with envelope improvements (insulation, air sealing, windows) to reduce total heating load. New construction increasingly defaults to all-electric design as building codes evolve—jurisdictions from New York City to Vancouver have restricted fossil fuel connections in new buildings.

Industrial electrification targets process heat, the largest energy use in manufacturing. Low-temperature heat (below 200°C) for food processing, textiles, and chemicals is readily electrifiable with heat pumps and electric boilers. Medium-temperature applications (200-600°C) can use industrial heat pumps, electric resistance heating, or electromagnetic technologies. High-temperature processes (above 1,000°C for cement, glass, steel) remain challenging but are addressable through electric arc furnaces, plasma torches, and induction heating—technologies that are commercially available but require scale-up and cost reduction.

Grid capacity and infrastructure are often the binding constraint. A commercial fleet depot switching 50 diesel trucks to electric may require a multi-megawatt grid connection upgrade. Industrial electrification can dramatically increase a facility's electricity demand. Proactive engagement with utilities, investment in on-site generation and storage, and demand management strategies are essential components of any large-scale electrification plan.

## Council Fire's Approach

Council Fire helps organizations develop electrification roadmaps that integrate technology selection, infrastructure planning, energy procurement, and financial analysis. We assess fleet electrification readiness, model building conversion economics, evaluate industrial electrification pathways, and coordinate with utility engagement to ensure grid capacity aligns with electrification timelines and demand growth.

## Frequently Asked Questions

### Does electrification reduce emissions if the grid is still fossil-fuel heavy?
Yes, in most cases. Because electric technologies are dramatically more efficient than combustion alternatives, electrification typically reduces emissions even on a moderately dirty grid. A heat pump operating at 300% efficiency powered by a grid at 400g CO2/kWh produces less CO2 per unit of heat than a 90%-efficient gas furnace. As grids continue to decarbonize, the emissions advantage of electrified systems improves over the lifetime of the equipment.

### What are the biggest barriers to electrification?
Grid capacity and interconnection timelines are often the most immediate constraint—utilities may require 2-5 years to upgrade connections for large new electrical loads. Upfront capital costs for equipment replacement remain higher than fossil fuel alternatives in some applications, though lifecycle economics usually favor electrification. Workforce skills gaps (electricians, heat pump installers, EV technicians) constrain deployment speed. And in heavy industry, some high-temperature processes lack commercially mature electric alternatives at the required scale.

### How should companies sequence electrification investments?
Start with the highest-impact, lowest-risk conversions: fleet vehicles with predictable routes and overnight depot charging, buildings with aging heating systems due for replacement, and industrial processes with commercially proven electric alternatives. Use natural equipment replacement cycles to avoid stranded asset costs. Coordinate with utility planners early to ensure grid capacity. And pair electrification with renewable energy procurement to maximize the emissions benefit from day one.
