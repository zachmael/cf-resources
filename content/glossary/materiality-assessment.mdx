## What is a Materiality Assessment?

A materiality assessment is a structured process for identifying and prioritizing the environmental, social, and governance topics that are most significant to an organization and its stakeholders. It determines which sustainability issues warrant disclosure, strategic focus, and resource allocation. The output—typically a materiality matrix or ranked list—forms the foundation of sustainability reporting and strategy.

## Why It Matters

Materiality assessments are the starting point for credible ESG reporting under virtually every major framework. GRI has required them since its earliest iterations. The CSRD mandates a double materiality assessment as a prerequisite for reporting under the European Sustainability Reporting Standards (ESRS). ISSB standards (IFRS S1 and S2) center on financial materiality. Without a defensible materiality assessment, companies risk reporting on the wrong topics—wasting resources on immaterial disclosures while overlooking the issues that actually drive risk and value.

The regulatory environment has made this more urgent. Under the CSRD, companies must document their materiality assessment methodology, including how they identified stakeholders, gathered input, and applied thresholds. Auditors and assurance providers will review this documentation. A superficial exercise—checking boxes without genuine analysis—creates both compliance risk and reputational exposure.

Beyond compliance, materiality assessments force strategic clarity. When leadership must decide which of 40+ potential ESG topics truly matter to the business, it triggers conversations about risk appetite, competitive positioning, and long-term value creation. Companies that treat materiality as a genuine strategic exercise—rather than a reporting prerequisite—consistently develop more focused and effective sustainability programs.

The process also builds internal alignment. Cross-functional participation in materiality assessments breaks down silos between sustainability, finance, risk, legal, and operations teams. When these groups jointly evaluate the significance of topics like water stress, human rights in supply chains, or data privacy, they develop shared language and priorities that persist well beyond the assessment itself.

## How It Works / Key Components

**Scoping and universe definition** is the first step. The organization compiles a long list of potentially material ESG topics, drawing from industry standards (SASB, GRI sector standards), peer benchmarks, regulatory requirements, media analysis, and internal risk registers. For a manufacturing company, this universe might include 30–50 topics ranging from greenhouse gas emissions and water use to worker safety, product stewardship, and community relations.

**Stakeholder engagement** follows. Internal stakeholders—board members, executives, middle management, and functional experts—provide perspectives on business impact and strategic relevance. External stakeholders—investors, customers, employees, suppliers, regulators, and community representatives—weigh in on the topics that matter most to them. Methods range from surveys and interviews to workshops and advisory panels. The depth and rigor of engagement directly affects the credibility of the final assessment.

**Evaluation and prioritization** applies defined criteria to rank topics. Under double materiality (required by CSRD), each topic is assessed on two dimensions: its impact on people and the environment (impact materiality) and its effect on the company's financial position and performance (financial materiality). Topics scoring high on either dimension are considered material. The resulting matrix or heat map visualizes where topics fall and which rise to the level of mandatory disclosure.

**Validation and governance** ensures the results hold up to scrutiny. Best practice involves review by senior leadership or a sustainability committee, with final approval at the board level. The methodology, data sources, stakeholder inputs, and decision criteria should be documented thoroughly—this documentation becomes part of the assurance evidence package and demonstrates the rigor of the process.

## Council Fire's Approach

Council Fire conducts materiality assessments that satisfy both CSRD double materiality requirements and investor-oriented financial materiality expectations. We facilitate cross-functional workshops, design stakeholder engagement programs, and produce documented, audit-ready outputs that serve as the foundation for reporting strategy, target-setting, and ongoing ESG program management.

## Frequently Asked Questions

### How often should a materiality assessment be refreshed?
Best practice is a comprehensive reassessment every three years, with annual reviews to check whether significant changes—new regulations, market shifts, M&A activity, or emerging risks—warrant updates. The CSRD does not specify a fixed cycle but expects companies to maintain current assessments that reflect evolving circumstances.

### What's the difference between single and double materiality?
Single materiality evaluates ESG topics based on one dimension—typically their financial relevance to the company (the ISSB approach). Double materiality, required by the CSRD and GRI, adds a second dimension: the company's impact on people, society, and the environment. A topic can be material under double materiality even if it doesn't affect the company's financials, as long as the company's activities have significant outward impacts.

### How many topics typically emerge as material?
Most assessments yield 10–15 material topics for reporting and strategic focus. The exact number depends on industry, geographic footprint, and stakeholder expectations. Reporting on too few topics raises questions about completeness; reporting on too many dilutes focus and strains resources. The goal is a defensible, prioritized set that reflects genuine business and stakeholder significance.
