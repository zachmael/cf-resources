## What is ESG Data Management?

ESG data management encompasses the systems, processes, and governance structures organizations use to collect, validate, store, and report environmental, social, and governance data. It spans the entire data lifecycle—from source capture at individual facilities or business units through aggregation, quality assurance, and disclosure in sustainability reports, regulatory filings, and stakeholder communications.

## Why It Matters

ESG data is the foundation of every sustainability report, target, and claim a company makes. Yet unlike financial data, which benefits from decades of standardized accounting rules, ERP systems, and audit infrastructure, ESG data remains immature in most organizations. A 2024 PwC survey found that 67% of companies still rely on spreadsheets as their primary ESG data management tool—a finding that should alarm anyone preparing for assurance requirements.

The shift from voluntary to mandatory reporting has raised the bar dramatically. Under the CSRD, ESG data will be subject to assurance—initially limited, moving to reasonable. This means ESG data must meet standards of completeness, accuracy, consistency, and traceability comparable to financial reporting. Companies that manage emissions data in Excel, collect social metrics via email, and lack documented data governance policies face significant remediation costs.

Data quality issues cascade. If your Scope 2 emissions figure is based on estimated electricity consumption because facility-level metering data is incomplete, every metric built on that figure—carbon intensity ratios, progress toward science-based targets, year-over-year trend analysis—is unreliable. Investors increasingly scrutinize underlying data quality, and assurance providers will test it.

The competitive dimension is also emerging. Companies with mature ESG data management capabilities can respond faster to investor questionnaires, benchmark more accurately against peers, identify operational efficiencies hidden in granular environmental data, and adapt quickly as reporting standards evolve. Data maturity is becoming a competitive advantage.

## How It Works / Key Components

**Data architecture and collection** establishes how ESG data flows from source to report. This includes defining data owners at each level (facility, business unit, region, corporate), specifying data sources (utility meters, HR systems, ERP, supplier platforms), establishing collection frequencies, and building automated data feeds where possible. The goal is minimizing manual handoffs and eliminating single-point-of-failure spreadsheets.

**Data quality and validation** implements controls to catch errors before they reach reports. This includes automated range checks (flagging outlier values), completeness checks (identifying missing data points), consistency checks (comparing across periods and sites), and reconciliation procedures (tying ESG data back to source documents). Financial auditors call these "internal controls over financial reporting"—ESG needs equivalent rigor through internal controls over sustainability reporting (ICSR).

**Governance and metadata management** documents who is responsible for what, how data definitions are maintained, and how changes are controlled. A data governance framework for ESG should define roles (data owners, data stewards, data custodians), establish a central data dictionary (ensuring "Scope 1 emissions" means the same thing across all business units), and maintain version control over methodologies, emission factors, and calculation approaches.

**Audit trail and documentation** ensures every reported figure can be traced back to its source. This means logging data inputs, calculation steps, adjustments, approvals, and any manual overrides. When an assurance provider asks "how did you arrive at this number?" the answer should be a documented chain of evidence, not a phone call to someone who remembers.

## Council Fire's Approach

Council Fire helps organizations build ESG data management capabilities that are assurance-ready from day one. We assess current data maturity, design governance frameworks, implement validation controls, and establish the documentation standards that assurance providers expect—bridging the gap between where most companies are today and where CSRD and ISSB requirements demand they be.

## Frequently Asked Questions

### Should we build ESG data management into our existing ERP or use a standalone platform?
Both approaches work, and the right choice depends on your IT landscape and timeline. Extending ERP systems (SAP, Oracle) provides tight integration with financial data and existing controls but requires significant IT investment and longer implementation timelines. Standalone ESG platforms (Sphera, Persefoni, Watershed) deploy faster and are purpose-built for sustainability data but may create integration challenges. Many organizations adopt a hybrid approach: standalone platforms for collection and calculation, with key outputs feeding into ERP for consolidated reporting.

### What are the most common ESG data quality issues?
The top issues we see are: incomplete site coverage (not all facilities reporting), inconsistent methodologies across business units (different emission factor sources), lack of supporting documentation for manual entries, estimation overuse without transparent disclosure, and temporal misalignment (mixing calendar-year and fiscal-year data). Most of these stem from decentralized, spreadsheet-based processes rather than any fundamental data availability problem.

### How long does it take to implement assurance-ready ESG data management?
For a mid-to-large enterprise starting from spreadsheet-based processes, expect 12–18 months to design and implement a governance framework, deploy a data management platform, establish validation controls, and complete at least one full reporting cycle under the new system. Companies already using dedicated ESG software may need only 6–9 months to close gaps in documentation, controls, and audit trail requirements.
