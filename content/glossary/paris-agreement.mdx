## What is the Paris Agreement?

The Paris Agreement is an international climate treaty adopted by 196 parties at COP21 in Paris on December 12, 2015, and entered into force on November 4, 2016. Its central aim is holding the increase in global average temperature to well below 2°C above pre-industrial levels while pursuing efforts to limit the increase to 1.5°C. The agreement operates through a bottom-up structure where each party sets its own Nationally Determined Contributions (NDCs) with a "ratchet mechanism" requiring progressively more ambitious targets every five years.

## Why It Matters

The Paris Agreement reshaped the global climate governance architecture. Previous attempts — notably the Kyoto Protocol — imposed top-down binding targets on developed countries only, leaving major emitters like China and India without obligations. Paris solved the participation problem by allowing all countries to set their own targets while creating transparency and review mechanisms to build collective ambition over time. The result: 196 parties covering virtually all global emissions.

The agreement's temperature targets have become the reference point for climate action across sectors. The 1.5°C target, in particular, has driven a cascade of commitments. The Science Based Targets initiative requires corporate targets consistent with 1.5°C. Central banks use Paris-aligned scenarios for stress testing. Asset managers commit to Paris-aligned portfolios. Insurance underwriters assess whether clients' business models are compatible with Paris goals. The agreement's targets have effectively become the organizing framework for the global economy's relationship with climate risk.

Despite near-universal participation, implementation lags ambition. The UNEP Emissions Gap Report consistently finds that current NDCs, even if fully implemented, would result in approximately 2.5–2.9°C of warming by 2100. The Glasgow Climate Pact (COP26, 2021) strengthened language around 1.5°C and called for phasing down coal. The Sharm el-Sheikh Implementation Plan (COP27, 2022) established the Loss and Damage fund. The UAE Consensus (COP28, 2023) called for "transitioning away from fossil fuels" — the first COP decision text to reference fossil fuels directly.

The first Global Stocktake, completed at COP28 in 2023, assessed collective progress toward Paris goals. The findings were stark: the world is not on track for any of the agreement's long-term goals. Emissions need to fall 43% by 2030 (relative to 2019) for 1.5°C and 27% for 2°C — requiring unprecedented acceleration of action. The next round of NDCs, due in 2025, represents a critical test of whether the ratchet mechanism can deliver the required ambition.

## How It Works / Key Components

NDCs are the backbone of the agreement. Each party submits targets covering emission reductions, adaptation plans, and financial commitments, updated every five years with increasing ambition. The first round of NDCs (2016) was widely recognized as insufficient. The second round (2020–2023) showed improvement but remained below the trajectory needed for 1.5°C. The enhanced transparency framework, operational from 2024, requires standardized reporting of emissions and progress using common methodologies.

The agreement's Article 6 establishes mechanisms for international carbon market cooperation. Article 6.2 allows bilateral transfers of "internationally transferred mitigation outcomes" (ITMOs) between countries. Article 6.4 creates a new crediting mechanism supervised by a UN body, replacing the Kyoto Protocol's Clean Development Mechanism. Rules for Article 6 were finalized at COP26 in Glasgow, including provisions to avoid double-counting of emission reductions. These mechanisms could reduce the cost of meeting Paris targets by $250 billion annually, according to the IETA.

Climate finance commitments are integral to the agreement. Developed countries pledged $100 billion per year in climate finance for developing countries by 2020 — a target finally met (by some accounting) in 2022. At COP29, a new collective quantified goal for post-2025 climate finance will be negotiated. The adequacy and accessibility of climate finance remain contentious — developing countries argue that current flows are insufficient, overly loan-based, and difficult to access.

The adaptation framework under Article 7 recognizes the global goal on adaptation and calls for enhanced adaptive capacity, reduced vulnerability, and strengthened resilience. The Glasgow-Sharm el-Sheikh work programme on the global goal on adaptation is developing indicators and targets to make adaptation progress measurable — a significant challenge given adaptation's context-specific nature.

## The Paris Agreement in Practice

The EU has translated its Paris commitments into the European Green Deal, a comprehensive legislative package targeting 55% emission reduction by 2030 (relative to 1990) and climate neutrality by 2050. Implementation includes the ETS reform, CBAM, the Fit for 55 package, and the CSRD. The legislative specificity — hundreds of binding measures across energy, transport, agriculture, and finance — demonstrates what serious Paris implementation looks like.

Costa Rica submitted one of the most ambitious NDCs, targeting net-zero emissions by 2050 with detailed sector-level pathways. The country already generates over 98% of electricity from renewables and has reversed deforestation, doubling forest cover since the 1980s through payment-for-ecosystem-services programs. Costa Rica's example shows that ambitious climate action is feasible for smaller economies with strong institutional commitment.

## Council Fire's Approach

Council Fire helps organizations align their strategies with Paris Agreement goals through science-based target development, transition planning, and stakeholder communication. We work with clients to translate the agreement's global temperature targets into sector-specific, operationally relevant decarbonization pathways. Our expertise in ocean and coastal systems is particularly relevant to Paris implementation — marine ecosystems are simultaneously affected by warming and essential to meeting Paris targets through blue carbon and sustainable ocean economies. We ensure that climate commitments are communicated with the credibility and specificity that investors, regulators, and communities increasingly demand.

## Frequently Asked Questions

### Is the Paris Agreement legally binding?
The agreement itself is a binding treaty under international law. However, the specific emission reduction targets in NDCs are not binding — there are no enforcement mechanisms or penalties for missing targets. The accountability mechanism relies on transparency, peer pressure, and the ratchet cycle requiring increasing ambition. This "binding framework, voluntary targets" structure was the compromise that enabled universal participation. Some legal scholars argue that the obligation to submit and pursue NDCs creates meaningful legal expectations even without enforcement.

### Can the world still meet the 1.5°C target?
Technically, 1.5°C remains achievable but the window is closing rapidly. Global emissions would need to decline 43% by 2030 and reach net zero by approximately 2050. Current trajectories show emissions still rising. Temporary overshoot of 1.5°C followed by drawdown through carbon removal is increasingly the assumed pathway. The IPCC's AR6 characterizes 1.5°C scenarios as requiring "rapid, far-reaching, and unprecedented changes in all aspects of society." Whether such changes are politically feasible at the required speed remains the fundamental question.

### What happens when a country withdraws from the Paris Agreement?
Article 28 allows withdrawal after three years of membership, with one year's notice. The US under Trump withdrew effective November 4, 2020, and rejoined on February 19, 2021 under Biden. Withdrawal has limited practical legal effect — domestic policies, not international agreements, determine actual emissions. However, withdrawal signals reduced climate ambition and can weaken diplomatic pressure on other large emitters. The US withdrawal period demonstrated that subnational actors (states, cities, companies) can maintain climate action momentum independently.
