## What is Carbon Pricing?

Carbon pricing is an economic policy tool that assigns a direct cost to greenhouse gas emissions, typically measured in dollars or euros per metric tonne of CO2 equivalent. By making pollution expensive, carbon pricing creates a financial incentive for emitters to reduce their output and invest in cleaner alternatives. The two primary forms are carbon taxes (a fixed price per tonne) and cap-and-trade systems (a market-determined price within a capped framework).

## Why It Matters

Carbon pricing is widely regarded by economists as the most efficient mechanism for driving economy-wide emissions reductions. By internalizing what was previously an externality—the climate damage caused by each tonne of emissions—it allows markets to find the least-cost abatement opportunities without prescribing specific technologies or behaviors. As of 2025, over 70 carbon pricing instruments are in operation globally, covering approximately 23% of worldwide greenhouse gas emissions and generating over $100 billion annually in government revenue.

The economic logic is straightforward: when emitting carbon costs money, every business decision becomes partially a carbon decision. Fuel procurement, equipment purchases, facility design, supply chain configuration—all of these choices shift when carbon carries a price. This embedded incentive structure scales in ways that prescriptive regulation cannot, because it harnesses the distributed decision-making power of millions of economic actors rather than relying on centralized mandates.

For corporations, carbon pricing affects competitiveness in both direct and indirect ways. Direct compliance costs hit regulated emitters through carbon taxes or cap-and-trade obligations. Indirect costs flow through supply chains as carbon-intensive inputs become more expensive. Companies that reduce their carbon intensity ahead of regulatory requirements gain competitive advantage through lower operating costs, while laggards face margin compression.

The trend toward higher carbon prices and broader coverage is accelerating. The EU ETS has seen prices rise from single digits in 2017 to sustained levels above €80 since 2023. Canada's federal carbon price is scheduled to reach CAD 170 per tonne by 2030. Even in jurisdictions without explicit carbon pricing, implicit carbon costs through fuel standards, efficiency mandates, and procurement requirements are rising. Organizations that ignore this trajectory do so at significant financial risk.

## How It Works / Key Components

Carbon pricing mechanisms fall into two broad categories. A carbon tax sets a fixed price per tonne of emissions, providing cost certainty but leaving the actual emissions reduction outcome uncertain. A cap-and-trade system sets an emissions ceiling and lets market trading determine the price, providing environmental certainty but leaving costs variable. Hybrid approaches—such as cap-and-trade with price floors and ceilings—attempt to deliver both forms of certainty.

Revenue generated by carbon pricing can be recycled in various ways that affect economic outcomes. Some jurisdictions return revenue to households as dividends (as in Canada's federal backstop program), some invest in clean energy infrastructure, and others reduce other taxes to maintain revenue neutrality. The revenue recycling mechanism significantly influences public acceptance and economic efficiency of the pricing instrument.

Effective carbon pricing requires robust measurement, reporting, and verification (MRV) infrastructure. Covered entities must accurately quantify their emissions, report to regulators, and submit to third-party verification. The scope of coverage matters enormously—pricing that covers only a fraction of an economy's emissions creates leakage risks where activity migrates to uncovered sectors or jurisdictions.

Border carbon adjustments are emerging as a critical complement to carbon pricing. The EU's Carbon Border Adjustment Mechanism (CBAM), phasing in from 2026, imposes carbon costs on imports of carbon-intensive goods to prevent "carbon leakage"—the relocation of production to jurisdictions with weaker climate policy. This development signals that carbon pricing is evolving from a domestic policy tool to a feature of international trade architecture.

## Council Fire's Approach

Council Fire helps organizations understand their exposure to current and emerging carbon pricing regimes across all operating jurisdictions. We model financial impacts under various carbon price scenarios, develop internal carbon pricing frameworks that align investment decisions with regulatory trajectories, and advise on strategic positioning to capture competitive advantage from the transition to a carbon-priced economy.

## Frequently Asked Questions

### What is the "right" price for carbon?
Estimates of the social cost of carbon—the economic damage caused by each additional tonne of emissions—vary widely, from $50 to over $200 per tonne depending on modeling assumptions, discount rates, and damage functions. The Biden administration's EPA estimated roughly $190 per tonne in 2023 dollars. In practice, politically feasible carbon prices remain below these estimates in most jurisdictions, though the gap is narrowing as climate impacts intensify and ambition increases.

### Does carbon pricing hurt economic competitiveness?
Evidence from jurisdictions with established carbon pricing shows limited competitiveness impacts when policies are well-designed. British Columbia's carbon tax, in place since 2008, has not undermined the province's economic growth relative to peers. The EU ETS provides free allowances to sectors deemed at risk of carbon leakage. Border carbon adjustments further address competitiveness concerns. The more relevant question for most companies is not whether carbon pricing hurts the economy broadly, but how to position for competitive advantage within a carbon-priced landscape.

### How does carbon pricing interact with other climate regulations?
Carbon pricing typically operates alongside—not instead of—other regulatory instruments. Emissions standards, renewable portfolio mandates, building codes, and technology incentives all coexist with carbon pricing in most jurisdictions. This policy layering can create interactions: a binding renewable mandate may suppress demand for carbon allowances, lowering the carbon price. Well-designed policy frameworks consider these interactions to avoid redundancy and ensure the carbon price signal remains effective.

### Should companies wait for regulation or adopt internal carbon pricing now?
Proactive adoption of internal carbon pricing offers significant strategic value. It stress-tests investment decisions against likely future compliance costs, identifies emissions reduction opportunities that will become economically attractive as prices rise, and builds organizational capacity for carbon management ahead of regulatory mandates. Companies like Microsoft, Unilever, and Shell have used internal carbon prices ranging from $15 to over $100 per tonne to guide capital allocation decisions for years.
