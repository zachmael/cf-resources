## What is a Benefit Corporation?

A benefit corporation is a legal corporate form that expands fiduciary duty beyond shareholder wealth maximization to include consideration of the company's impact on society and the environment. Unlike traditional C corporations, benefit corporations are legally authorized—and in some jurisdictions required—to pursue a general public benefit as part of their stated corporate purpose. This legal structure provides directors with protection from shareholder lawsuits alleging that stakeholder-oriented decisions breached fiduciary duty. As of 2026, benefit corporation legislation exists in over 40 US states, the District of Columbia, and several international jurisdictions including Italy, Colombia, Ecuador, and France.

## Why It Matters

The benefit corporation addresses a structural problem in corporate law that has constrained purpose-driven business for decades. Under the prevailing interpretation of fiduciary duty in most US states—shaped by cases like Dodge v. Ford Motor Company (1919) and eBay v. Newmark (2010)—directors face legal risk when they prioritize stakeholder interests over shareholder returns. This legal architecture creates a chilling effect: even directors who believe in stakeholder capitalism hesitate to act on it without explicit legal authorization.

Maryland became the first state to enact benefit corporation legislation in 2010, and the model has spread rapidly. The legal innovation matters because it aligns corporate governance with the reality that long-term value creation depends on healthy relationships with employees, communities, suppliers, and ecosystems. Patagonia's 2022 decision to transfer ownership to a trust and nonprofit dedicated to fighting climate change was legally facilitated by its benefit corporation status—a move that would have been far more complicated under traditional corporate law.

For investors, the benefit corporation form provides clarity rather than ambiguity. Investors in benefit corporations know from the outset that the company will balance profit with purpose. This reduces the risk of governance conflicts that arise when shareholders with different expectations collide. Impact investors, in particular, prefer the benefit corporation structure because it provides legal assurance that mission will survive leadership transitions, capital raises, and potential acquisitions.

The form is also gaining traction in exit scenarios. Acquirers of benefit corporations must acknowledge the stakeholder governance framework, creating a protection mechanism against mission drift during ownership changes. This has made benefit corporations particularly attractive to founders seeking to build enduring institutions rather than flip-ready startups.

## How It Works / Key Components

Benefit corporation status is established at incorporation or through amendment of existing articles of incorporation, with shareholder approval typically requiring a two-thirds supermajority vote. The corporate charter must include a statement of general public benefit—defined as a material positive impact on society and the environment. Companies may also specify particular public benefits, such as preserving the environment, improving human health, or promoting economic opportunity for underserved communities.

Directors of benefit corporations have an expanded fiduciary duty that explicitly includes consideration of the company's impact on stakeholders: employees, customers, community, local and global environment, and the long-term interests of the corporation. This is not a vague aspiration—it is a legal standard that directors must reference in decision-making. In Delaware, the Public Benefit Corporation statute requires the board to balance pecuniary interests of stockholders, the best interests of those materially affected by the corporation's conduct, and the specific public benefit identified in the certificate of incorporation.

Transparency is a core requirement. Most benefit corporation statutes require companies to publish an annual benefit report assessing their performance against a third-party standard. Commonly used standards include the B Impact Assessment (administered by B Lab), the Global Reporting Initiative, and the UN Sustainable Development Goals. This reporting requirement creates public accountability that goes beyond what is required of traditional corporations.

The legal protections work in both directions. Directors are shielded from claims that pursuing public benefit constitutes a breach of fiduciary duty. Simultaneously, benefit enforcement proceedings allow shareholders to hold directors accountable for failing to pursue the stated public benefit. This bidirectional accountability structure makes the benefit corporation form more robust than voluntary commitments or corporate purpose statements that lack legal enforceability.

## Council Fire's Approach

Council Fire advises organizations considering the benefit corporation structure as part of their commitment to climate resilience and sustainable business. We help clients evaluate whether the legal form aligns with their governance needs, investor expectations, and stakeholder commitments—particularly for companies whose operations intersect with ocean and coastal ecosystems where balancing profit with environmental stewardship is not optional but existential.

## Frequently Asked Questions

### Do benefit corporations receive any tax advantages?

No. Benefit corporations are taxed identically to traditional corporations in their respective jurisdiction. The benefit corporation form is a governance structure, not a tax classification. Companies can be benefit corporations and simultaneously elect S corporation or C corporation tax status. Some advocates have proposed tax incentives for benefit corporations, but no US jurisdiction has enacted such provisions as of 2026. The advantages of the form are legal (expanded fiduciary duty, director protection) and reputational (credible signal of stakeholder commitment), not fiscal.

### Can an existing corporation convert to benefit corporation status?

Yes. Conversion typically requires amending the certificate of incorporation to include the public benefit purpose, approved by a supermajority (usually two-thirds) of outstanding shares. The process varies by state but generally involves board approval, shareholder vote, and filing amended documents with the secretary of state. Companies should anticipate that conversion may trigger appraisal rights, allowing dissenting shareholders to demand payment for their shares at fair value. Planning for this possibility—including clear communication about why the conversion serves long-term enterprise value—is essential.

### How do benefit corporations differ internationally?

The concept has been adapted to different legal traditions. Italy's Società Benefit, enacted in 2016, was the first non-US benefit corporation legislation and closely mirrors the US model. France's Entreprise à Mission (2019) requires companies to define a "raison d'être" and establish a mission committee with independent oversight. Colombia and Ecuador have enacted similar frameworks. The UK lacks specific benefit corporation legislation but permits companies to embed social purposes in articles of association under existing company law. The common thread is the legal authorization to pursue stakeholder value—but the enforcement mechanisms, reporting requirements, and governance details differ significantly across jurisdictions.
