## What is Climate Migration?

Climate migration describes the displacement or relocation of people caused directly or indirectly by climate change impacts. This includes sudden displacement from extreme weather events — hurricanes, floods, wildfires — and slow-onset migration driven by drought, sea-level rise, desertification, and declining agricultural productivity. The World Bank estimates that by 2050, 216 million people could be forced to move within their own countries due to climate impacts, with sub-Saharan Africa, South Asia, and Latin America most affected.

## Why It Matters

Climate migration is already reshaping demographics, labor markets, and political systems. The Internal Displacement Monitoring Centre recorded 32.6 million new disaster-related displacements in 2022 — more than three times the number displaced by conflict. These aren't abstract projections; they're people moving today.

The economic implications are massive. Climate-driven migration strains receiving communities' housing, infrastructure, and public services while hollowing out sending regions' workforces and tax bases. The National Bureau of Economic Research estimates that climate change could reduce US county-level GDP by 1–5% through migration-related productivity shifts by 2050. Globally, the costs of climate displacement — including lost livelihoods, emergency response, and resettlement — run into hundreds of billions annually.

Legal frameworks haven't caught up. The 1951 Refugee Convention doesn't recognize climate as grounds for refugee status. People fleeing flooded coastlines or drought-stricken farmland have no guaranteed legal protections in receiving countries. The Global Compact on Migration (2018) acknowledges climate as a migration driver but isn't binding. This legal vacuum leaves millions in limbo — unable to stay, unprotected when they move.

For businesses, climate migration affects workforce availability, real estate markets, and consumer geography. Companies with facilities in climate-vulnerable regions face talent retention challenges as workers relocate. Real estate values in receiving cities rise while sending regions experience decline. Insurance availability shapes where people can afford to live, creating feedback loops that accelerate migration from the most exposed areas.

## How It Works / Key Components

Climate migration falls into three categories: displacement (forced, sudden movement from acute events), migration (gradual relocation driven by slow-onset changes), and planned relocation (organized community movement, often government-led). Each involves different timescales, governance challenges, and humanitarian needs.

Sudden displacement typically follows extreme weather. When Hurricane Maria struck Puerto Rico in 2017, an estimated 130,000–200,000 residents relocated to the US mainland. Many never returned. Wildfire evacuations in California, Greece, and Australia increasingly become permanent as repeated burns make rebuilding untenable. Flood displacement is the largest single category — affecting 14 million people in Pakistan's 2022 floods alone.

Slow-onset migration responds to gradually worsening conditions. In the Sahel, declining rainfall and advancing desertification have driven decades of southward migration, contributing to conflict in Nigeria, Mali, and Burkina Faso. Small island nations like Tuvalu, Kiribati, and the Marshall Islands face existential sea-level rise that will render entire countries uninhabitable within decades. In the American Southwest, chronic drought and groundwater depletion are restructuring agricultural communities.

Planned relocation — sometimes called "managed retreat" — represents the most organized response. The US has relocated several communities, including Isle de Jean Charles in Louisiana, where land loss from subsidence and sea-level rise left a 98% reduction in habitable area. Indonesia is building a new capital, Nusantara, partly because Jakarta is sinking. These relocations are logistically complex, culturally disruptive, and politically difficult — but increasingly necessary.

## Climate Migration in Practice

Bangladesh operates one of the world's most extensive climate migration corridors. Rising seas, intensifying cyclones, and riverbank erosion displace an estimated 700,000 people annually. Many relocate to Dhaka, which has grown from 3 million to over 22 million people in four decades, straining infrastructure and creating sprawling informal settlements. The government's Bangladesh Delta Plan 2100 attempts to manage this dynamic through integrated water management, climate-resilient agriculture, and planned urbanization.

Within the US, the "climate belt" thesis — that Midwest and Great Lakes cities will receive climate migrants from coastal and Sun Belt regions — is beginning to influence municipal planning and real estate investment. Buffalo, Duluth, and Cincinnati have initiated strategies to welcome climate migrants, investing in housing capacity and infrastructure upgrades.

## Council Fire's Approach

Council Fire addresses climate migration through our integrated resilience and stakeholder strategy practice. We help coastal communities and ocean-dependent industries develop managed retreat frameworks that preserve community identity and economic function during relocation. Our storytelling expertise is critical here — migration decisions involve deeply emotional attachments to place, and effective communication can make the difference between community-led adaptation and traumatic displacement. We work with municipalities, tribal nations, and private sector clients to plan for migration as a manageable transition rather than a crisis response.

## Frequently Asked Questions

### Are there "climate refugees" under international law?
Not currently. The 1951 Refugee Convention defines refugees based on persecution, not environmental conditions. Several countries — including New Zealand and Finland — have explored climate-specific visa categories, but no binding international framework recognizes climate migrants' right to cross-border protection. The Nansen Initiative and its successor, the Platform on Disaster Displacement, work to fill this governance gap through non-binding guidelines and regional agreements.

### How does climate migration affect real estate markets?
Climate migration creates divergent trends: declining values in high-risk areas (coastal flood zones, wildfire-prone regions, extreme heat corridors) and rising values in perceived climate havens. First Street Foundation estimates that $21 billion in US property value has already been lost to sea-level rise perceptions. Insurance withdrawal amplifies the effect — when insurers leave a market, mortgage availability drops and values follow. These dynamics disproportionately affect lower-income homeowners who can't absorb losses.

### What can cities do to prepare for climate in-migration?
Receiving cities should invest in housing supply (including affordable housing), infrastructure capacity (water, transit, schools, healthcare), and social integration services. Zoning reform, building code updates, and workforce development programs help absorb population growth productively. The key is planning proactively rather than reacting to crisis — cities that wait until migrants arrive face much higher costs and social friction than those that prepare.
