## What is Heat Action Plans?

Heat action plans (HAPs) are coordinated frameworks that governments, employers, and organizations deploy to mitigate the health and economic impacts of extreme heat events. A HAP typically includes early warning systems, public communication protocols, cooling infrastructure activation, worker protection mandates, and emergency medical response coordination. Ahmedabad, India pioneered the modern municipal HAP model in 2013 after a devastating 2010 heat wave killed over 1,300 people, and the approach has since been adopted by hundreds of cities globally.

## Why It Matters

Extreme heat is the deadliest weather hazard in the United States, killing more people annually than hurricanes, tornadoes, and floods combined. The Lancet Countdown reported that heat-related mortality among people over 65 increased by 85% between 2000–2004 and 2017–2021 globally. Climate projections indicate that days above 35°C will increase by 50–100% across most mid-latitude regions by 2050 under moderate emissions scenarios.

The economic toll extends beyond healthcare. A 2024 ILO report estimated that heat stress costs the global economy $2.4 trillion annually in lost productivity, with outdoor workers in agriculture, construction, and logistics bearing disproportionate impacts. In the U.S., OSHA data shows heat-related workplace fatalities have increased steadily, prompting the agency to initiate its first federal heat standard rulemaking in 2021.

Cities face compounding risk from the urban heat island effect, where dense built environments absorb and re-radiate solar energy, pushing urban temperatures 5–10°C above surrounding rural areas. Phoenix recorded a record 31 consecutive days above 43°C (110°F) in 2023, overwhelming cooling infrastructure and contributing to over 600 heat-associated deaths in Maricopa County that year. Cities without formal heat action plans consistently see higher mortality rates during comparable heat events.

For corporations, heat exposure creates material operational and liability risks. Worker productivity declines measurably above 28°C for manual labor and above 32°C for moderate physical activity. Supply chain disruptions from heat-buckled rail lines, power grid failures during peak cooling demand, and agricultural yield losses ripple through global value chains. Companies with operations in heat-exposed regions need systematic heat risk management integrated into business continuity planning.

## How It Works / Key Components

Effective heat action plans operate on a tiered alert system calibrated to local heat-health thresholds. These thresholds vary by geography and population acclimatization—a dangerous heat event in Seattle (where fewer than 50% of homes have air conditioning) may not trigger alerts in Houston. Most HAPs use three to four alert levels tied to forecast temperature, humidity, duration, and nighttime cooling potential.

At the municipal level, a comprehensive HAP includes: early warning dissemination through media, mobile alerts, and community networks; activation of cooling centers in public buildings; extended hours for pools and libraries; outreach to vulnerable populations (elderly, unhoused, outdoor workers) through social services and community organizations; suspension of utility shutoffs during heat emergencies; and coordination with hospitals and EMS for surge capacity.

Workplace heat action plans add layer-specific controls. OSHA's proposed heat standard would require employers to provide water, rest, and shade when the heat index reaches 80°F, with enhanced measures (mandatory rest breaks, buddy systems, acclimatization protocols for new workers) above 90°F. Leading companies already implement wet-bulb globe temperature monitoring, modified work-rest cycles, and physiological monitoring for high-risk roles.

Infrastructure investments support long-term heat resilience: cool roofs and cool pavements that reflect rather than absorb solar radiation, expanded urban tree canopy (which can reduce surface temperatures by 10–15°C under shade), district cooling networks, and building code updates mandating passive cooling design. Singapore's "80-80-80" strategy aims for 80% of buildings within a 10-minute walk of a park, demonstrating how urban planning integrates with heat management.

## Council Fire's Approach

Council Fire develops heat action plans for municipalities and corporate clients by combining downscaled climate projections with demographic vulnerability mapping and operational exposure analysis. We design tiered response protocols, worker safety programs, and infrastructure investment roadmaps that reduce heat-related risks to people, productivity, and assets while aligning with emerging regulatory requirements like OSHA's heat standard and CSRD climate adaptation disclosures.

## Frequently Asked Questions

### What makes a heat action plan effective versus performative?

The evidence points to three critical success factors: locally calibrated thresholds (not generic national standards), proactive outreach to vulnerable populations (not just public announcements), and post-event review with mortality and morbidity data analysis. Ahmedabad's HAP reduced heat-related mortality by an estimated 1,100 deaths annually after implementation because it combined all three elements. Plans that exist only on paper without funded activation protocols and community partnerships show minimal impact.

### Are employers legally required to protect workers from heat?

As of early 2026, the U.S. federal OSHA heat standard remains in rulemaking, but several states have enacted their own requirements. California, Washington, Oregon, Colorado, and Minnesota have enforceable heat illness prevention standards for outdoor workers, with some extending to indoor environments. The EU's Framework Directive on Safety and Health at Work requires employers to maintain safe thermal conditions, though specific thresholds vary by member state. Even absent regulation, employers face general duty clause liability and workers' compensation exposure for heat-related illness and death.

### How do heat action plans intersect with ESG reporting?

Heat risk management maps directly to multiple ESG disclosure frameworks. Under the CSRD's ESRS E1 (Climate Change), companies must disclose climate adaptation measures including heat-related operational risks. TCFD and its successor ISSB standards require scenario-based assessment of physical climate risks, where extreme heat is a primary hazard. CDP's climate change questionnaire asks explicitly about physical risk management. Worker heat safety also falls under social metrics (ESRS S1 on Own Workforce) covering occupational health and safety management systems.
