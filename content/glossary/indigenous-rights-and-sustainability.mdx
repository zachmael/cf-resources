## What is Indigenous Rights and Sustainability?

Indigenous rights and sustainability refers to the recognition that the land rights, traditional ecological knowledge, cultural practices, and self-determination of indigenous peoples are inseparable from—and essential to—achieving global sustainability outcomes. Indigenous peoples constitute approximately 6% of the world's population but manage or hold tenure over at least 25% of the global land surface, including 40% of remaining terrestrial protected areas and 37% of remaining natural lands. Their territories store an estimated 24% of above-ground tropical forest carbon. The intersection of indigenous rights and sustainability recognizes that protecting these rights is not merely an ethical obligation but a practical necessity for biodiversity conservation, climate mitigation, and ecosystem management.

## Why It Matters

The evidence linking indigenous land management to superior environmental outcomes is robust. A 2021 meta-analysis in Environmental Science & Policy found that deforestation rates in indigenous territories with secure land tenure are 2.5 to 3 times lower than in comparable non-indigenous areas. The Brazilian Amazon illustrates this dramatically: indigenous territories experienced 3% deforestation between 2000 and 2020, compared to 19% in adjacent non-indigenous areas. These findings have been replicated across geographies—from the boreal forests of Canada to the tropical forests of Indonesia—and reflect centuries of land management practice that balances human use with ecological maintenance.

Despite their outsized contribution to environmental stewardship, indigenous peoples face persistent rights violations, land dispossession, and exclusion from governance. The UN Special Rapporteur on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples has documented forced displacement from protected areas, criminalization of customary land use, failure to obtain free, prior, and informed consent for development projects, and violence against indigenous land defenders—an estimated 200 of whom are killed annually, according to Global Witness. The climate and conservation communities have been complicit: "fortress conservation" models that exclude indigenous peoples from protected areas have been shown to be both less effective at conservation and deeply unjust.

Climate change disproportionately affects indigenous communities. Arctic indigenous peoples face the collapse of ice-dependent livelihoods and cultures. Pacific Island nations—many with indigenous populations—face existential sea level rise. Indigenous communities in drought-prone regions of Africa, Australia, and the Americas experience food and water insecurity intensified by changing climate patterns. Yet indigenous peoples receive a negligible share of climate finance: the Rainforest Foundation Norway estimated that just 7% of total climate funding for tropical forests reaches indigenous and local communities.

The policy landscape is shifting. The Kunming-Montreal Global Biodiversity Framework (2022) explicitly recognizes the role of indigenous peoples and local communities in its 30x30 conservation target. The UNFCCC's Local Communities and Indigenous Peoples Platform has institutionalized—if not yet empowered—indigenous participation in climate governance. Several countries, including Colombia and Ecuador, have enshrined indigenous environmental rights in their constitutions. These developments represent progress, but the gap between recognition and implementation remains vast.

## How It Works / Key Components

The legal framework for indigenous rights rests on several international instruments. ILO Convention 169 (1989) establishes the right to consultation and participation in decisions affecting indigenous territories and resources. The UN Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples (UNDRIP, 2007) affirms rights to self-determination, land tenure, cultural preservation, and free, prior, and informed consent (FPIC). The Convention on Biological Diversity's Nagoya Protocol addresses benefit-sharing from the use of traditional knowledge associated with genetic resources. National implementation varies enormously—from strong constitutional recognition in Bolivia and New Zealand to effectively absent protections in many Asian and African nations.

Free, prior, and informed consent is the cornerstone operational standard. FPIC requires that indigenous communities are consulted before any project or policy affects their lands or resources, that consent is given freely (without coercion or manipulation), that it is obtained prior to approval (not as an afterthought), and that communities have full information about the project's impacts and alternatives. The International Finance Corporation's Performance Standard 7 requires FPIC for projects with impacts on indigenous peoples, and the Equator Principles extend this requirement to most large-scale project finance. Implementation quality varies—some processes genuinely empower communities, while others are performative exercises designed to legitimate predetermined outcomes.

Indigenous and traditional ecological knowledge (TEK) represents millennia of accumulated understanding about ecosystem dynamics, species behavior, and sustainable resource management. Fire management practices of Aboriginal Australians, maintained for over 60,000 years, reduce catastrophic wildfire risk while maintaining ecological diversity—and are now being adopted by Australian land management agencies. Traditional fisheries management in the Pacific Islands, based on customary marine tenure and seasonal closures, maintains fish stocks more effectively than many modern regulatory frameworks. Integrating TEK with Western science—on equal terms, with appropriate intellectual property protections—produces more effective conservation and climate adaptation strategies than either knowledge system alone.

Rights-based conservation models are replacing exclusionary approaches. Indigenous and Community Conserved Areas (ICCAs) recognize that communities can be effective conservation stewards without state-imposed restrictions. Co-management arrangements share governance authority between indigenous communities and government agencies. Indigenous Protected and Conserved Areas (IPCAs) in Canada establish indigenous-led conservation governance. These models consistently demonstrate that securing indigenous rights and achieving conservation goals are complementary rather than competing objectives.

## Council Fire's Approach

Council Fire recognizes indigenous rights and traditional knowledge as foundational to effective climate resilience and environmental management. In our work across coastal, marine, and land-based systems, we prioritize engagement with indigenous communities as partners and knowledge holders, applying FPIC principles and benefit-sharing frameworks. Our ocean systems expertise intersects directly with indigenous marine tenure and customary fisheries management, and we work to ensure that conservation and adaptation strategies respect and strengthen—rather than undermine—indigenous governance and knowledge systems.

## Frequently Asked Questions

### What is free, prior, and informed consent (FPIC) and when is it required?

FPIC is the right of indigenous peoples to give or withhold consent for projects or policies that affect their lands, territories, and resources. "Free" means without coercion, intimidation, or manipulation. "Prior" means consent is sought sufficiently in advance of any authorization or commencement. "Informed" means communities receive full, accessible information about the project's nature, scope, impacts, and alternatives. FPIC is required under ILO Convention 169, UNDRIP, and the IFC Performance Standards for any project with potential impacts on indigenous peoples. Critically, FPIC includes the right to say no—it is consent, not consultation. Companies and governments that treat FPIC as a bureaucratic hurdle rather than a genuine expression of self-determination undermine both indigenous rights and their own project viability.

### How does indigenous land management contribute to climate mitigation?

Indigenous-managed lands store approximately 24% of above-ground tropical forest carbon—an estimated 218 gigatons of CO₂ equivalent. Securing indigenous land tenure prevents the deforestation and degradation that would release this carbon. Studies in Brazil, Colombia, and Indonesia consistently find deforestation rates 2–3 times lower in indigenous territories than in comparable areas without indigenous governance. The cost-effectiveness is exceptional: securing indigenous land tenure costs an estimated $5–10 per ton of CO₂ equivalent avoided, compared to $50–100+ for many technological carbon removal approaches. Investing in indigenous land rights is one of the most cost-effective climate mitigation strategies available—yet it receives a fraction of climate finance.

### How should companies engage with indigenous communities on sustainability projects?

Begin by understanding the specific indigenous groups whose lands and interests may be affected, their governance structures, and their legal and customary rights. Engage early—before project design is finalized—and through culturally appropriate processes that respect indigenous decision-making protocols. Provide independent technical and legal support to communities so they can evaluate proposals on equal terms. Develop benefit-sharing agreements that reflect community priorities, not company assumptions about what communities need. Establish transparent monitoring and grievance mechanisms. And recognize that indigenous communities are not homogeneous—internal diversity of perspective is normal, and engagement processes must be inclusive within the community, not just between the company and selected leaders. Companies that invest in genuine partnership build durable social license and access traditional knowledge that improves project outcomes.
