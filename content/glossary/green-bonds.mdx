## What is a Green Bond?

A green bond is a fixed-income instrument whose proceeds are exclusively allocated to finance or refinance projects with environmental benefits. These projects typically fall into categories including renewable energy, energy efficiency, clean transportation, sustainable water management, pollution prevention, biodiversity conservation, and climate change adaptation. Green bonds follow the same credit fundamentals as conventional bonds—they carry the same credit risk, are rated by the same agencies, and trade in the same markets—but add a layer of environmental use-of-proceeds commitment and reporting. The first green bond was issued by the European Investment Bank in 2007; the market has since grown into a trillion-dollar asset class.

## Why It Matters

Green bonds are the most established instrument in the sustainable finance toolkit, providing a direct link between capital markets and environmental outcomes. Global green bond issuance reached $575 billion in 2024, according to the Climate Bonds Initiative, bringing cumulative issuance past the $3 trillion mark. This scale matters because the International Energy Agency estimates clean energy investment alone must reach $4.5 trillion annually by 2030 to stay on a net-zero trajectory. Green bonds are not sufficient to close this financing gap, but they are among the most effective mechanisms for mobilizing institutional capital at scale.

For issuers, green bonds offer tangible benefits beyond environmental signaling. The "greenium"—the yield discount green bonds command relative to conventional equivalents—has averaged 2-8 basis points across investment-grade issuers, reducing borrowing costs. Green bonds also attract a broader and more diversified investor base, as dedicated ESG mandates and sustainability-focused funds participate alongside conventional fixed-income investors. This demand diversification enhances pricing stability and reduces refinancing risk.

Sovereign issuers have embraced the instrument as a policy tool. France, Germany, the United Kingdom, Italy, and over 30 other countries have issued sovereign green bonds, using proceeds to fund national climate and environmental programs. Germany's twin-bond model—issuing green and conventional bonds with identical terms—has provided the clearest market evidence of green premiums and established a benchmark for sovereign sustainable debt.

For investors, green bonds offer portfolio alignment with climate commitments without sacrificing credit quality or liquidity. The Bloomberg MSCI Green Bond Index has delivered risk-adjusted returns comparable to the Bloomberg Global Aggregate Index, demonstrating that environmental use-of-proceeds requirements do not impair financial performance. Pension funds, insurance companies, and sovereign wealth funds increasingly use green bonds to meet portfolio decarbonization targets while maintaining fixed-income allocation discipline.

## How It Works / Key Components

Green bond issuance follows a structured process governed by market standards. The International Capital Market Association's (ICMA) Green Bond Principles (GBP), first published in 2014 and regularly updated, establish four core components: use of proceeds, process for project evaluation and selection, management of proceeds, and reporting. These voluntary principles form the foundation of market practice and are referenced by virtually all green bond issuers.

Use of proceeds is the defining feature. Issuers must specify eligible project categories and commit to allocating bond proceeds accordingly. Proceeds are typically tracked through a dedicated sub-account or internal tracking system, and issuers report annually on allocation and, increasingly, on the environmental impact of financed projects. Impact reporting might include metrics such as tonnes of CO₂ avoided, megawatts of renewable capacity installed, or hectares of ecosystem restored.

External review provides credibility. Most green bonds receive a second-party opinion (SPO) from providers such as Sustainalytics, ISS ESG, CICERO, or Vigeo Eiris, confirming alignment with the Green Bond Principles and assessing the environmental credentials of eligible projects. The EU Green Bond Standard, which entered force in 2024, goes further—requiring alignment of proceeds with the EU Taxonomy for Sustainable Activities and external review by an EU-registered verifier. This regulatory standard sets the highest bar globally and is expected to influence other jurisdictions.

The Climate Bonds Standard and Certification Scheme, administered by the Climate Bonds Initiative, provides an additional layer of verification with sector-specific eligibility criteria. Certified Climate Bonds must demonstrate that financed assets and projects are consistent with Paris Agreement objectives, applying science-based thresholds by sector—solar, wind, transport, water, buildings, and more. Over $250 billion in bonds have been certified under this scheme.

## Council Fire's Approach

Council Fire advises issuers and investors on green bonds with a particular focus on ocean and coastal applications—an area where green bond frameworks are rapidly evolving to include blue economy projects. We help clients structure credible green and blue bond frameworks, identify eligible projects in marine conservation and coastal resilience, and develop impact reporting methodologies that meet both market standards and scientific integrity requirements.

## Frequently Asked Questions

### What is the difference between a green bond and a sustainability-linked bond?

The distinction is fundamental. A green bond commits proceeds to specific environmental projects—the "use of proceeds" model. The issuer's overall ESG performance is not directly relevant; what matters is that bond proceeds fund eligible projects. A sustainability-linked bond (SLB) does not restrict use of proceeds but instead ties the bond's financial characteristics—typically the coupon rate—to the issuer's achievement of predetermined sustainability performance targets (SPTs). If the issuer misses its targets, the coupon steps up, increasing borrowing costs. Green bonds fund green projects; SLBs incentivize green corporate performance. Both serve important but distinct roles in sustainable finance.

### Are green bonds more expensive to issue than conventional bonds?

The direct costs are modestly higher due to the requirement for external review, proceeds tracking, and impact reporting—typically adding $20,000-$100,000 per issuance depending on complexity. However, the greenium (yield discount) that green bonds command in the secondary market often more than offsets these costs, particularly for frequent issuers who amortize setup costs across multiple transactions. For first-time issuers, the investment in developing a green bond framework also builds institutional capacity for sustainable finance that benefits future issuances. The net cost-benefit is generally favorable for investment-grade issuers with sufficient eligible project pipelines.

### How can investors verify that green bond proceeds are actually used for environmental purposes?

Three mechanisms provide assurance. First, pre-issuance second-party opinions verify the credibility of the green bond framework and eligible project categories. Second, annual allocation reports—often externally reviewed—disclose how proceeds have been deployed. Third, impact reports quantify the environmental outcomes of financed projects using standardized metrics. The EU Green Bond Standard adds a fourth layer: mandatory alignment with the EU Taxonomy and post-issuance review by a registered external verifier. Investors should also assess issuer credibility holistically—a company with a strong overall environmental track record is more likely to deliver on green bond commitments than one using the instrument to offset otherwise poor environmental performance.
