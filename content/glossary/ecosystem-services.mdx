## What is Ecosystem Services?

Ecosystem services are the direct and indirect contributions that ecosystems make to human wellbeing. Categorized by the Millennium Ecosystem Assessment (2005) into four types—provisioning (food, water, timber), regulating (climate regulation, flood control, pollination), cultural (recreation, spiritual value, aesthetic appreciation), and supporting (nutrient cycling, soil formation, primary production)—these services represent the economic value that nature provides to societies, often without market recognition.

## Why It Matters

The economic value of ecosystem services is immense and largely unpriced. A seminal study by Robert Costanza and colleagues estimated global ecosystem services at $125 trillion annually—exceeding global GDP. Despite this value, ecosystem services are treated as free inputs in most economic models and corporate accounting, leading to systematic overexploitation and degradation.

The consequences of degraded ecosystem services are increasingly tangible. Pollinator decline threatens $235-577 billion in annual crop production globally. Wetland loss reduces natural flood protection, increasing infrastructure costs—the US Army Corps of Engineers estimates that coastal wetlands prevented $625 million in flood damages during Hurricane Sandy alone. Deforestation disrupts rainfall patterns that agriculture depends on, creating cascading economic impacts.

The concept of ecosystem services bridges ecology and economics, enabling cost-benefit analyses that include nature's contributions. This framing has proven effective in policy contexts: Costa Rica's Payments for Ecosystem Services program, which compensates landowners for maintaining forest cover, has driven reforestation while sustaining agricultural productivity. Similar programs operate in over 60 countries.

For corporations, understanding ecosystem service dependencies and impacts is becoming a governance responsibility. The TNFD framework explicitly requires organizations to assess their dependencies on ecosystem services, identifying where nature's degradation could disrupt operations, supply chains, or markets. Companies dependent on water purification, soil fertility, or climate stability face material risks from ecosystem service decline.

## How It Works / Key Components

Provisioning services are the tangible products obtained from ecosystems: food, fresh water, fiber, fuel, and genetic resources. These services are most directly recognized in economic systems because they are traded in markets. However, market prices rarely reflect the full cost of production—a commodity price for wheat does not account for the soil formation, pollination, and water cycling that produced it.

Regulating services moderate natural phenomena that affect human wellbeing. Climate regulation through carbon sequestration and storage in forests, soils, and oceans. Water purification through wetland filtration and soil processing. Flood regulation through watershed retention, floodplain storage, and coastal buffering. Disease regulation through predator-prey dynamics that control vector populations. These services typically have no market price despite enormous economic value.

Cultural services provide non-material benefits: recreation and tourism (nature-based tourism generates $600+ billion annually), cultural identity tied to landscapes and species, educational value, and mental health benefits of nature exposure. While difficult to quantify, these services significantly influence land use decisions, property values, and quality of life.

Valuation methods range from market-based approaches (the value of timber from a forest) to revealed preference methods (what people pay to visit national parks) to stated preference methods (what people would pay to protect a species). The Economics of Ecosystems and Biodiversity (TEEB) initiative and the System of Environmental-Economic Accounting (SEEA) provide standardized frameworks for integrating ecosystem service values into economic decision-making.

## Council Fire's Approach

Council Fire helps organizations map their ecosystem service dependencies and impacts, quantify nature-related risks and opportunities, and integrate ecosystem service valuation into strategic planning and disclosure. We translate ecological science into the financial language that boards and investors understand.

## Frequently Asked Questions

### How do you put a dollar value on ecosystem services?
Multiple methods exist: replacement cost (what would it cost to engineer the same service?), avoided damage (what losses does the service prevent?), production function (how does the service contribute to market goods?), and stated preference (what would people pay to maintain it?). Each has strengths and limitations; practitioners often use multiple methods for triangulation.

### Are ecosystem services the same as natural capital?
Related but distinct. Natural capital refers to the stock of natural assets (forests, soils, water, atmosphere). Ecosystem services are the flows of benefits that natural capital generates. A forest (natural capital) provides timber, carbon sequestration, water purification, and recreation (ecosystem services). Managing natural capital sustainably ensures continued ecosystem service flows.

### What happens when ecosystem services decline?
Societies must either pay for technological substitutes (water treatment plants replacing wetland filtration, managed pollination replacing wild pollinators), absorb the costs of service loss (flood damage, crop failures), or invest in ecosystem restoration. Substitution is typically far more expensive than maintaining natural systems.
