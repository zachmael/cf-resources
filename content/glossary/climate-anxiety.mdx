## What is Climate Anxiety?

Climate anxiety — also called eco-anxiety or climate distress — encompasses the chronic fear, grief, anger, and helplessness that individuals experience in response to the climate crisis and perceived inadequacy of societal responses. A landmark 2021 study published in The Lancet Planetary Health surveyed 10,000 young people across ten countries and found that 75% described the future as "frightening" and 56% felt "humanity is doomed." Climate anxiety is not a clinical diagnosis but a rational emotional response to a genuine existential threat — one with measurable consequences for wellbeing, productivity, and organizational performance.

## Why It Matters

Climate anxiety is a workforce issue, not just a personal one. A 2023 Yale Program on Climate Change Communication survey found that 65% of Americans are at least "somewhat worried" about climate change, with 29% "very worried." Among workers aged 18–34 — the cohort entering peak career years — climate concern runs even higher. Deloitte's 2024 Gen Z and Millennial Survey found that climate change is the top concern for both generations, ahead of cost of living and unemployment.

The impact on employee engagement, retention, and performance is measurable. Workers experiencing climate distress report difficulty concentrating, reduced motivation, and a desire to work only for organizations aligned with climate action. A 2022 study in Nature Climate Change found that climate anxiety predicted reduced occupational functioning independent of general anxiety and depression. Employers who ignore this dynamic face talent attrition — particularly among the high-performing, values-driven employees most likely to have options.

Direct climate impacts compound psychological effects. First responders, healthcare workers, and communities directly affected by wildfires, floods, and heat waves experience post-traumatic stress, depression, and substance use disorders at elevated rates. After Hurricane Maria, surveys found PTSD symptoms in 31% of Puerto Rican adults. The 2023 Canadian wildfires affected air quality for 100 million+ North Americans, generating widespread anxiety about health consequences. As extreme events intensify, the affected population grows.

For organizations committed to sustainability, climate anxiety creates a paradox: the employees most engaged with climate work are often the most psychologically burdened by it. Sustainability professionals report high rates of burnout, moral injury (the distress of knowing what's needed while seeing insufficient action), and compassion fatigue. Managing this requires organizational support systems, not just individual coping strategies.

## How It Works / Key Components

Climate anxiety operates through several psychological mechanisms. Anticipatory grief — mourning losses that haven't fully materialized — creates ongoing distress as people process projected losses of ecosystems, species, places, and ways of life. Existential anxiety arises from the perceived threat to human civilization and future generations. Moral distress results from the gap between knowing what action is needed and perceiving that governments and corporations are failing to act. Solastalgia — a term coined by philosopher Glenn Albrecht — describes the distress caused by environmental change in one's home environment.

The cognitive dimension involves difficulty processing the scale and timeframe of climate change. The human brain evolved to respond to immediate, tangible threats, not slow-moving, probabilistic, global-scale risks. This mismatch creates a pattern of oscillating between hyperarousal (panic, obsessive information consumption) and avoidance (numbing, denial, disengagement). Neither extreme supports effective action.

Constructive engagement pathways channel anxiety into action. Research consistently shows that participation in collective climate action — community organizing, workplace sustainability programs, political advocacy — reduces anxiety more effectively than individual lifestyle changes alone. The mechanism is agency: collective action provides both practical impact and psychological relief through social connection and shared purpose. Organizations that provide structured pathways for employee climate engagement report higher morale and retention.

Cultural and demographic dimensions shape the experience. Indigenous communities face compounded grief from climate impacts on ancestral lands and cultural practices. Young people carry the burden of inheriting a destabilized climate they didn't create. Climate-vulnerable communities in the Global South experience anxiety layered on top of immediate survival pressures. Effective responses must be culturally informed and equity-centered.

## Climate Anxiety in Practice

Patagonia has explicitly addressed climate anxiety as a workplace issue, offering employees paid environmental internships, supporting climate activism, and creating internal communities for processing climate grief. The company's "Don't Buy This Jacket" campaigns acknowledged the tension between business activity and environmental impact — a transparency that reduced cognitive dissonance for employees and customers alike.

The Climate Psychology Alliance, based in the UK, has developed frameworks for therapists to address climate distress without pathologizing appropriate emotional responses to real threats. Their approach distinguishes between adaptive anxiety (which motivates protective action) and maladaptive anxiety (which paralyzes), helping practitioners support clients in channeling distress productively.

## Council Fire's Approach

Council Fire recognizes that climate anxiety is both a stakeholder engagement challenge and a human reality within the organizations we serve. Our storytelling practice is built on the understanding that effective climate communication must acknowledge fear and grief while providing pathways to agency and action. We help organizations develop internal climate engagement programs that channel employee concern into productive participation, and external communications that motivate stakeholders without triggering paralysis. Honest, specific, action-oriented narrative — not false optimism or doom — is the foundation of our approach.

## Frequently Asked Questions

### Is climate anxiety a mental health disorder?
No. Climate anxiety is not classified as a clinical disorder in the DSM-5 or ICD-11. Mental health professionals increasingly recognize it as a rational, proportionate emotional response to a genuine threat. However, climate distress can trigger or exacerbate clinical conditions including generalized anxiety disorder, major depression, and PTSD — particularly in people with pre-existing vulnerabilities or direct exposure to climate disasters. The distinction matters: pathologizing climate anxiety implies the problem is in the individual, not the crisis.

### How should employers address climate anxiety in the workplace?
Evidence-based approaches include providing structured opportunities for climate engagement (sustainability committees, volunteering programs, green teams), ensuring that corporate climate commitments are credible and transparent (nothing amplifies climate anxiety like greenwashing), offering mental health resources that include climate-literate counselors, and creating psychologically safe spaces for employees to express climate concern. Importantly, action matters more than talk — employees' anxiety decreases when they see their employer taking meaningful climate action.

### Does climate anxiety affect consumer behavior?
Yes, significantly. Climate-anxious consumers show increased preference for sustainable products, willingness to pay premiums for climate-friendly options, and brand loyalty to companies perceived as climate leaders. However, anxiety can also drive avoidance behaviors — consumers may disengage from climate information entirely if they feel overwhelmed. Marketing that acknowledges concern while offering tangible individual and collective actions performs better than either doom-laden messaging or shallow greenwashing.
