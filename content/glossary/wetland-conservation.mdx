## What is Wetland Conservation?

Wetland conservation encompasses the protection, management, and restoration of wetland ecosystems — including marshes, swamps, peatlands, bogs, floodplains, and shallow lakes — to maintain their ecological functions and the services they provide to human communities. The Ramsar Convention on Wetlands, the oldest multilateral environmental agreement (1971), defines wetlands broadly as areas of marsh, fen, peatland, or water, whether natural or artificial, permanent or temporary. Conservation strategies range from legal protection and sustainable management to active restoration of degraded systems.

## Why It Matters

Wetlands are disproportionately valuable relative to their area. Covering roughly 6% of the Earth's land surface, they deliver ecosystem services estimated at $47 trillion per year — more per hectare than any other ecosystem type. Wetlands filter water, buffer floods, recharge aquifers, sequester carbon, support fisheries, and host extraordinary biodiversity.

Despite this value, wetlands are disappearing faster than any other ecosystem. The Ramsar Convention's Global Wetland Outlook (2021) documented a 35% decline in natural wetland extent since 1970, with losses accelerating in recent decades. Agricultural conversion, urban expansion, drainage infrastructure, and water diversion are the primary drivers. Peatland drainage alone accounts for approximately 4% of global anthropogenic CO₂ emissions — releasing centuries of stored carbon when these systems are dried and degraded.

The flood mitigation value of wetlands carries direct fiscal implications. The US Army Corps of Engineers estimates that wetlands in the Upper Mississippi basin prevent $7.9 billion in flood damages annually. During Hurricane Harvey (2017), areas near Houston with intact wetlands experienced significantly less property damage than comparable areas where wetlands had been filled for development. As extreme precipitation events intensify under climate change, the economic case for wetland conservation strengthens.

Wetlands are also critical for water security. They function as natural water treatment facilities — removing nitrogen, phosphorus, and sediment from surface water — and recharge groundwater supplies that billions of people depend on. Destroying wetlands degrades water quality downstream and increases the cost of engineered water treatment infrastructure.

## How It Works / Key Components

Legal protection forms the first layer of wetland conservation. The Ramsar Convention designates Wetlands of International Importance (Ramsar Sites), with over 2,500 sites covering 256 million hectares across 172 countries. National legislation varies widely — the US Clean Water Act protects jurisdictional wetlands through Section 404 permitting, while the EU Water Framework Directive and Habitats Directive provide complementary protections across member states.

Hydrological management is often the most critical technical intervention. Wetlands are defined by water — their depth, duration, timing, and chemistry of inundation determine ecological character. Conservation therefore requires maintaining or restoring natural hydrological regimes, which may mean removing drainage infrastructure, reconnecting floodplains to rivers, or managing water allocations to ensure environmental flows reach wetland systems.

Peatland conservation and rewetting have gained prominence as a climate mitigation strategy. Intact peatlands store an estimated 600 gigatonnes of carbon — roughly double the carbon stored in all the world's forests. Rewetting drained peatlands stops the oxidation of stored carbon and, over time, restores the system's capacity to sequester additional carbon. The EU's proposed Nature Restoration Law includes specific targets for peatland rewetting, and carbon market methodologies for peatland projects are maturing rapidly.

Community-based conservation is essential in landscapes where wetlands intersect with livelihoods. In the Mekong Delta, Inner Niger Delta, and Sundarbans, millions of people depend on wetland fisheries, agriculture, and forest products. Conservation strategies that exclude local communities consistently fail. Successful approaches integrate traditional ecological knowledge, establish community management rights, and develop sustainable use frameworks that maintain both livelihoods and ecological function.

## Council Fire's Approach

Council Fire advises on wetland conservation as a component of climate resilience, water security, and nature-based infrastructure strategy. We help clients quantify the economic value of wetland ecosystem services, design conservation and restoration programs that integrate with broader landscape planning, and navigate the policy and financing frameworks — from Ramsar site management to carbon market participation — that support long-term wetland protection.

## Frequently Asked Questions

### What is the difference between wetland conservation and wetland restoration?
Conservation protects existing, functional wetlands from degradation or loss. Restoration rehabilitates wetlands that have been damaged or destroyed — typically by reversing drainage, removing fill, or reestablishing native vegetation and hydrology. Both are necessary: conservation prevents further loss while restoration recovers what has been degraded. Prevention is generally far more cost-effective than restoration.

### How do wetlands help with climate change?
Wetlands play a dual role. As carbon sinks, intact peatlands and coastal wetlands sequester significant quantities of CO₂. As adaptation infrastructure, wetlands buffer floods, moderate drought impacts, and protect coastlines from storm surge. Conversely, drained and degraded wetlands become major emission sources — making wetland destruction a climate problem and wetland conservation a climate solution.

### Are wetlands protected under international law?
The Ramsar Convention provides the primary international framework, but it is largely a voluntary commitment — it lacks binding enforcement mechanisms. Protection depends on national legislation and implementation. Many countries have strong wetland protection laws on paper but weak enforcement in practice. The effectiveness of wetland conservation ultimately depends on political will, institutional capacity, and the economic incentives aligned with protection versus conversion.
