## What is Scope 1 Emissions?

Scope 1 emissions are direct greenhouse gas emissions from sources that an organization owns or controls. These include emissions from combustion in owned boilers, furnaces, and vehicles; fugitive emissions from refrigeration and air conditioning systems; and process emissions from industrial manufacturing. The classification originates from the GHG Protocol Corporate Standard, the most widely used greenhouse gas accounting framework globally.

## Why It Matters

Scope 1 emissions represent the emissions most directly within an organization's operational control, making them the logical starting point for any decarbonization strategy. Unlike Scope 2 or Scope 3 emissions, which depend on external parties, Scope 1 reductions are achievable through direct operational decisions—replacing gas boilers with heat pumps, electrifying vehicle fleets, or upgrading industrial processes.

For heavy industry, Scope 1 emissions are often the dominant emissions category. Cement manufacturing, steel production, and chemical processing generate substantial process emissions that require fundamental technology shifts to abate. These sectors face particularly challenging decarbonization pathways, with solutions like green hydrogen and carbon capture still scaling.

Regulatory frameworks universally require Scope 1 reporting. The EU's Corporate Sustainability Reporting Directive (CSRD), the SEC's climate disclosure rule, and the ISSB's IFRS S2 all mandate Scope 1 disclosure. Many carbon pricing mechanisms—including the EU Emissions Trading System and California's cap-and-trade program—directly price Scope 1 emissions, creating a financial incentive for reduction.

Investors scrutinize Scope 1 performance as a proxy for management quality and transition risk exposure. Organizations with high Scope 1 intensity relative to peers signal operational inefficiency and vulnerability to rising carbon costs. Conversely, demonstrated Scope 1 reductions indicate strategic foresight and operational competence.

## How It Works / Key Components

Scope 1 emissions are calculated by multiplying activity data (fuel consumed, refrigerant leaked, materials processed) by emissions factors specific to each source. For combustion sources, this means tracking fuel volumes and applying factors from databases such as the EPA's Emission Factors Hub or DEFRA's conversion factors. Fugitive emissions require equipment inventories and leak detection data.

The major subcategories include stationary combustion (boilers, generators, furnaces), mobile combustion (company-owned vehicles, aircraft, ships), process emissions (chemical reactions in manufacturing), and fugitive emissions (refrigerant leaks, methane from coal mines). Each requires distinct measurement approaches and reduction strategies.

Reduction strategies follow a clear hierarchy. Energy efficiency improvements—better insulation, process optimization, waste heat recovery—deliver immediate savings. Fuel switching from coal or oil to natural gas provides transitional reductions, while electrification powered by renewable energy offers the deepest long-term abatement. For process emissions, emerging technologies like electric arc furnaces for steel or novel cement chemistries are critical.

Monitoring and verification ensure accuracy. Continuous emissions monitoring systems (CEMS) provide real-time data for large point sources, while smaller sources rely on periodic measurement and calculation-based approaches. Third-party verification under standards like ISO 14064-3 provides assurance to stakeholders.

## Council Fire's Approach

Council Fire works with clients to build comprehensive Scope 1 inventories, identify cost-effective reduction pathways, and establish monitoring systems that support both regulatory compliance and strategic decision-making. We prioritize reductions that deliver financial returns alongside emissions benefits, ensuring sustainability investments strengthen rather than strain the bottom line.

## Frequently Asked Questions

### What are common examples of Scope 1 emissions?
Common sources include natural gas combustion in buildings, diesel and gasoline in company vehicles, refrigerant leaks from HVAC systems, and process emissions from manufacturing. A logistics company's truck fleet, a manufacturer's furnaces, and a retailer's refrigeration units all generate Scope 1 emissions.

### How do Scope 1 emissions differ from Scope 2?
Scope 1 covers direct emissions from owned or controlled sources. Scope 2 covers indirect emissions from purchased electricity, heat, or steam. If a company burns natural gas on-site, those are Scope 1. If it purchases electricity from the grid, the emissions from generating that electricity are Scope 2.

### Are Scope 1 emissions the easiest to reduce?
They are the most directly controllable, but not necessarily the easiest. Electrifying a vehicle fleet or replacing industrial processes requires significant capital investment and planning. However, because the organization has direct operational control, the pathway is clearer than for Scope 3 emissions, which require influencing external parties.
