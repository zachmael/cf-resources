## What are Anti-Greenwashing Regulations?

Anti-greenwashing regulations are legal frameworks designed to prevent misleading environmental and sustainability claims by companies. They encompass a growing body of EU directives, national laws, financial sector rules, and enforcement actions that require environmental claims to be substantiated, specific, and verifiable—moving the market from self-declared sustainability credentials to evidence-based, regulated disclosure.

## Why It Matters

Greenwashing has eroded trust in sustainability claims to a critical point. A 2024 European Commission sweep of company websites found that 53% of environmental claims were vague, misleading, or unsubstantiated. The financial sector fares no better—DWS, a Deutsche Bank subsidiary, paid $25 million in SEC fines in 2023 for misrepresenting ESG integration in its investment processes. BNY Mellon, Goldman Sachs, and others have faced similar enforcement actions. The regulatory response has been swift and sweeping.

The EU has positioned itself as the global leader in anti-greenwashing enforcement through a layered regulatory approach. The Empowering Consumers Directive (2024) bans generic environmental claims ("eco-friendly," "green," "sustainable") unless substantiated under recognized certification schemes. The Green Claims Directive (proposed 2023, under negotiation) would require companies to substantiate environmental claims using lifecycle assessment methodologies before making them. The SFDR imposes anti-greenwashing requirements on financial products marketed as sustainable.

For companies, the compliance implications are significant. Marketing teams can no longer use aspirational environmental language without evidentiary backing. Product claims must be substantiated by robust data and methodology. ESG fund classifications must accurately reflect investment strategies and outcomes. The penalty landscape ranges from regulatory fines to consumer lawsuits, reputational damage, and—under SFDR—reclassification of financial products that can trigger investor redemptions.

The enforcement machinery is rapidly scaling. National consumer protection authorities, financial regulators, and the European Securities and Markets Authority (ESMA) have all signaled greenwashing as a priority. ESMA's 2024 guidelines on fund naming conventions restrict the use of "ESG," "sustainable," "green," and similar terms in fund names unless specific criteria are met. This isn't future risk—enforcement actions are happening now.

## How It Works / Key Components

**Claim substantiation requirements** form the core of anti-greenwashing law. Under the proposed Green Claims Directive, any explicit environmental claim must be supported by a scientific assessment based on widely recognized evidence, identifying significant environmental impacts, and demonstrating that the claim accurately reflects performance. Generic claims ("environmentally friendly") and claims based on carbon offsets alone are either banned or severely restricted.

**Disclosure and transparency obligations** require companies to make substantiation evidence accessible to consumers. This includes disclosing the methodology used, scope of the claim, underlying data, and any limitations. The goal is enabling consumers, regulators, and competitors to verify claims independently rather than relying on corporate assertions.

**Financial sector-specific rules** layer additional requirements on investment products. The SFDR categorizes funds as Article 6 (no sustainability claims), Article 8 (promotes environmental/social characteristics), or Article 9 (has sustainable investment as its objective). Misclassification—marketing a fund as Article 9 when its strategy doesn't meet the criteria—has triggered high-profile enforcement actions and fund reclassifications. ESMA estimates that over €175 billion in fund assets were reclassified from Article 9 to Article 8 in 2023 alone.

**Enforcement mechanisms** include administrative fines, injunctive relief, consumer redress, and criminal penalties in some jurisdictions. France's Loi Climat et Résilience can impose fines of up to 80% of the cost of a non-compliant advertising campaign. The proposed Green Claims Directive includes penalties of at least 4% of annual turnover. Private litigation is also increasing—NGOs and consumer groups are filing complaints that regulatory authorities are obligated to investigate.

## Council Fire's Approach

Council Fire helps organizations navigate the anti-greenwashing regulatory landscape by auditing existing environmental claims against current and emerging requirements, building substantiation processes that withstand regulatory scrutiny, and training marketing and communications teams on compliant claim-making. We ensure that sustainability messaging accurately reflects verified performance—protecting both reputation and legal standing.

## Frequently Asked Questions

### What counts as a "green claim" under the proposed regulations?
The Green Claims Directive defines environmental claims broadly: any message or representation that suggests a product, service, or the company itself has a positive or reduced negative impact on the environment. This includes text, imagery, labels, brand names, and marketing materials. Even implicit claims—such as using green packaging or nature imagery—may fall under scrutiny if they create a misleading impression of environmental performance.

### Can companies still use carbon offsets to support environmental claims?
Under the proposed regulations, claims of carbon neutrality based solely on offsetting are effectively prohibited. The Empowering Consumers Directive bans claims based on emissions offsetting schemes that a product has neutral, reduced, or positive environmental impact. Companies can still purchase offsets but cannot use them as the basis for consumer-facing environmental claims. The emphasis shifts to actual emissions reductions within operations and value chains.

### How should companies prepare for anti-greenwashing enforcement?
Start with a comprehensive audit of all current environmental claims across marketing materials, product packaging, investor communications, and websites. For each claim, document the evidence base, methodology, scope, and limitations. Remove or reformulate any claims that cannot be substantiated. Implement a review process for new claims that requires substantiation before publication. Companies in the financial sector should also review fund classifications and naming conventions against ESMA guidelines.
