## What is Climate Justice?

Climate justice recognizes that climate change disproportionately harms those who contributed least to its causes — low-income communities, Indigenous peoples, Global South nations, and marginalized populations. It reframes climate policy from a purely technical or environmental challenge to one rooted in human rights, equity, and historical accountability. The concept demands that climate solutions address systemic inequalities rather than reinforce them.

## Why It Matters

The distribution of climate impacts is profoundly unequal. The 46 Least Developed Countries contribute approximately 4% of global greenhouse gas emissions but face the most severe climate consequences. Within wealthy nations, the pattern repeats: Hurricane Katrina killed 1,800 people, disproportionately Black and low-income residents of New Orleans' Lower Ninth Ward. The 2021 Pacific Northwest heat dome killed over 600 people in the US and Canada, predominantly elderly, unhoused, and socially isolated individuals.

Climate justice has moved from activist framing to institutional policy. The Biden administration's Justice40 initiative directs 40% of federal climate investment benefits to disadvantaged communities. The EU's Social Climate Fund allocates €86.7 billion to cushion the distributional impacts of carbon pricing on vulnerable households. The COP27 agreement to establish a Loss and Damage fund acknowledged — for the first time in 30 years of UN climate negotiations — that wealthy nations bear responsibility for climate impacts in developing countries.

For businesses, climate justice is becoming a material consideration. Environmental justice lawsuits have targeted fossil fuel companies, chemical manufacturers, and utilities for disproportionate pollution in communities of color. Investors are scrutinizing "just transition" plans that address workforce and community impacts of decarbonization. Companies that ignore distributional impacts face regulatory, legal, and reputational consequences.

Corporate climate strategies that fail the justice test face growing opposition. Renewable energy projects sited without meaningful community engagement — including some large-scale wind and solar developments on Indigenous lands — have generated backlash that delays or kills projects. Effective climate action requires community consent, not just technical optimization.

## How It Works / Key Components

Climate justice operates across three dimensions: distributive justice (fair allocation of climate costs and benefits), procedural justice (meaningful participation in climate decision-making), and recognition justice (acknowledging historical harms, cultural contexts, and different knowledge systems).

Distributive justice asks who bears the costs of both climate impacts and climate solutions. Carbon taxes without revenue recycling can be regressive, taking a larger share of income from poor households that spend more on energy and transportation. Just transition programs — including worker retraining, community economic development, and social protection — attempt to distribute transition costs more equitably. Germany's coal phase-out allocated €40 billion to affected regions over 20 years.

Procedural justice demands that affected communities participate meaningfully in decisions that affect them. Free, Prior and Informed Consent (FPIC) for Indigenous communities is codified in the UN Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples and increasingly referenced in corporate sustainability standards. Climate-affected communities in Bangladesh's coastal zones, Pacific Island nations, and Arctic Indigenous communities bring direct knowledge of climate impacts that remote policymaking misses.

Recognition justice requires acknowledging the historical dimensions of climate inequity. Colonialism shaped patterns of resource extraction, land use, and economic development that concentrate both emissions and vulnerability. Indigenous land management practices — including controlled burning, rotational agriculture, and marine stewardship — represent climate knowledge that Western science is belatedly recognizing. Meaningful climate justice integrates these perspectives rather than treating affected communities as passive victims.

## Climate Justice in Practice

The Navajo Nation, which hosts abandoned uranium mines and coal plants that powered cities across the American Southwest while leaving many Navajo homes without electricity, exemplifies climate injustice. The 2019 closure of the Navajo Generating Station eliminated 800 jobs without adequate transition support. Subsequent efforts by the Navajo Tribal Utility Authority to develop community-scale solar projects demonstrate how energy transition can serve justice goals when communities lead.

Colombia's 2022 climate law explicitly integrates racial equity, recognizing that Afro-Colombian and Indigenous communities face disproportionate climate impacts from flooding, landslides, and ecosystem degradation. The law mandates differential adaptation funding for these communities and requires their participation in climate planning processes.

## Council Fire's Approach

Council Fire centers equity in every climate engagement. Our stakeholder strategy practice ensures that communities most affected by climate impacts — particularly coastal and ocean-dependent populations — have voice in planning processes, not just notification of decisions already made. We help organizations develop climate strategies that meet justice criteria, from supply chain labor standards to community benefit agreements for climate infrastructure projects. Our storytelling work amplifies the voices and knowledge of frontline communities, recognizing that justice requires changing who gets heard, not just what gets funded.

## Frequently Asked Questions

### How does climate justice apply to corporate strategy?
Climate justice requires companies to assess who benefits and who bears costs from both their emissions and their climate actions. This means evaluating whether emissions reduction strategies displace pollution to disadvantaged communities, whether renewable energy supply chains respect labor rights, whether facility closures include transition support for workers and communities, and whether climate adaptation investments protect the most vulnerable stakeholders, not just the most profitable assets.

### What is the relationship between climate justice and environmental justice?
Environmental justice addresses the disproportionate exposure of marginalized communities to pollution, hazardous waste, and environmental degradation — a framework developed primarily in the US civil rights context. Climate justice extends these principles to the global scale, encompassing historical emissions responsibility, international climate finance, and the distributional impacts of both climate change and climate policy. In practice, the two movements share constituencies, analytical frameworks, and policy goals.

### Can carbon markets advance climate justice?
Carbon markets have a mixed record. Poorly designed offset projects have displaced Indigenous communities, restricted traditional land use, and delivered minimal local benefit while generating credits for distant polluters. However, community-designed projects — including Indigenous forest management programs and community-owned renewable energy — can channel climate finance to frontline communities. The key factors are project governance, benefit-sharing, and whether communities hold decision-making power over projects on their land.
