## What is an Extreme Weather Event?

Extreme weather events are meteorological phenomena that fall at the tails of the historical statistical distribution — significantly hotter, wetter, drier, or more intense than typical conditions for a given place and season. Climate change is shifting these distributions, making events that were once rare increasingly frequent and severe. Attribution science now routinely quantifies how much climate change increased the likelihood or intensity of specific events, from heat waves to hurricanes to compound disasters.

## Why It Matters

The frequency and cost of extreme weather events are escalating on a trajectory that threatens economic stability. NOAA recorded 28 billion-dollar weather disasters in the US in 2023 alone — the highest annual count on record. Global insured losses from natural catastrophes exceeded $100 billion for the fourth consecutive year. Munich Re's data shows that weather-related losses have increased fivefold since the 1980s, even after adjusting for inflation and development.

Attribution science has transformed the conversation from "we can't blame any single event on climate change" to precise quantification. The 2023 European heat wave was made 100 times more likely by climate change. Hurricane Harvey's rainfall was 15% heavier and three times more probable. The 2021 Pacific Northwest heat dome would have been "virtually impossible" without anthropogenic warming, according to World Weather Attribution. These findings have direct implications for litigation, insurance pricing, and policy design.

Business interruption from extreme weather now rivals traditional operational risks. The 2011 Thailand floods disrupted automotive and electronics supply chains globally, causing $45 billion in total economic losses. The 2021 Texas winter storm knocked out power for 4.5 million households and caused $195 billion in damages. Hurricane Ian (2022) generated $113 billion in total losses. These events don't just affect directly impacted areas — they cascade through supply chains, financial markets, and insurance systems.

The compounding nature of extreme events creates novel risk profiles. Simultaneous heat and drought stress agriculture while increasing wildfire risk. Sequential hurricanes deplete emergency response capacity. Heat waves followed by rainfall events cause thermal shock to infrastructure. These compound and cascading events are poorly captured by historical risk models that assess hazards in isolation.

## How It Works / Key Components

The physics connecting climate change to extreme weather operates through several well-understood mechanisms. The Clausius-Clapeyron relation dictates that atmospheric moisture capacity increases approximately 7% per degree of warming, fueling more intense precipitation events. Warmer oceans provide more energy for tropical cyclones — the proportion of Category 4–5 hurricanes has increased roughly 25% per degree of sea surface temperature rise. Arctic amplification (the Arctic warming 2–4 times faster than the global average) weakens the jet stream, creating persistent weather patterns that lock heat domes, droughts, and cold outbreaks in place for weeks.

Heat waves are the fastest-intensifying extreme event category. The frequency of heat waves has increased threefold since the 1960s in most regions. Duration has extended — the average heat wave in the US is now 45 days longer than in the 1960s. Nighttime temperatures are rising faster than daytime peaks, eliminating the physiological recovery period that prevents heat illness. The combination of heat and humidity, measured by wet-bulb temperature, is approaching survivability limits (35°C wet bulb) in parts of South Asia and the Persian Gulf.

Wildfire behavior has transformed. The US wildfire season is 78 days longer than in the 1970s. The area burned annually in the western US has doubled since 1984. Megafires — exceeding 100,000 acres — have become routine. The 2023 Canadian wildfire season burned 18.5 million hectares, shattering records and sending smoke across the entire North American continent. Fire behavior is interacting with drought, beetle infestations, and decades of fire suppression to create conditions outside historical experience.

Drought patterns are shifting toward longer duration and broader geographic extent. The 2020–2023 Horn of Africa drought — the worst in 40 years — affected 37 million people and killed millions of livestock. The American Southwest's megadrought, the driest 22-year period in 1,200 years, has depleted reservoirs and forced water use restrictions across Colorado River basin states. Drought interacts with heat to compound agricultural losses, water stress, and ecosystem degradation.

## Extreme Weather Events in Practice

The reinsurance industry has fundamentally repriced extreme weather risk. Swiss Re's sigma report shows that the gap between total economic losses and insured losses has widened, leaving governments, businesses, and households increasingly exposed to uninsured residual risk. In response, parametric insurance products that pay based on event parameters (wind speed, rainfall, temperature) rather than damage assessment have grown to a $15+ billion market.

Japan's infrastructure adaptation program, following the devastating 2018 floods and typhoons, invested ¥7 trillion ($50 billion) in resilience upgrades including dam capacity expansion, levee reinforcement, and real-time flood prediction systems. The program explicitly designed infrastructure for climate-adjusted conditions rather than historical baselines — one of the first national programs to do so systematically.

## Council Fire's Approach

Council Fire helps organizations develop extreme weather preparedness strategies that go beyond conventional business continuity planning. Our climate resilience practice assesses how changing extreme event patterns affect operations, supply chains, and stakeholder communities — with particular depth in coastal storm risk where our ocean expertise provides granular understanding of storm surge, wave dynamics, and marine ecosystem damage. We help clients communicate extreme weather risk to boards and investors in terms that drive capital allocation toward resilience, not just recovery.

## Frequently Asked Questions

### Are extreme weather events getting worse, or are we just better at tracking them?
Both — but the intensification is dominant. Satellite and ground-station monitoring has improved detection, particularly for events in remote areas. However, the physical evidence for intensification is unambiguous: ocean heat content is at record levels, atmospheric moisture has increased measurably, and attribution studies consistently find that climate change is amplifying event severity and frequency. The statistical trends persist after correcting for improved observation and population growth in exposed areas.

### How do businesses quantify extreme weather risk?
Leading approaches combine historical loss analysis, forward-looking climate modeling, and asset-level exposure assessment. Tools like Jupiter Intelligence, Moody's (formerly Four Twenty Seven), and Climate Engine provide facility-level risk scoring under multiple climate scenarios. The key is moving beyond historical loss experience — which understates future risk — to probabilistic modeling that incorporates climate projections. Scenario analysis under TCFD frameworks provides the structure for integrating these assessments into strategic planning.

### Can infrastructure be designed to withstand increasing extremes?
Yes, but it requires abandoning the assumption that historical conditions define future risk. Climate-resilient infrastructure design uses projected conditions — not historical averages — as the design basis. This means larger drainage capacity, higher flood protection levels, heat-resistant materials, and redundant systems. The cost premium for climate-resilient design is typically 5–15% at construction, far less than the cost of retrofitting or rebuilding after failure. The challenge is regulatory — most building codes still reference historical climate data.
