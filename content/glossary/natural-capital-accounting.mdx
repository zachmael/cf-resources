## What is Natural Capital Accounting?

Natural capital accounting (NCA) is a systematic framework for measuring and valuing the stocks and flows of natural resources and ecosystem services in physical and monetary terms. It extends conventional economic accounting by incorporating assets like forests, freshwater systems, soil fertility, and biodiversity into balance sheets. The goal is to make the economic contributions of nature visible to decision-makers at corporate, national, and institutional levels.

## Why It Matters

Traditional GDP metrics and corporate financial statements treat natural resources as externalities — free inputs with no recorded depreciation. This blind spot has led to decades of ecological degradation justified by narrow economic logic. Natural capital accounting corrects this by assigning measurable value to ecosystem services such as pollination, water filtration, flood mitigation, and carbon storage. The UN estimates that ecosystem services contribute roughly $125 trillion annually to the global economy, yet most of this value goes unrecorded.

The adoption of the UN System of Environmental-Economic Accounting (SEEA) as an international statistical standard in 2012 — and its Ecosystem Accounting framework in 2021 — marked a turning point. Over 90 countries now implement some form of NCA, with the EU, UK, and several ASEAN nations leading integration into policy. For corporations, frameworks like the Taskforce on Nature-related Financial Disclosures (TNFD) are making natural capital assessment a baseline expectation for investors and regulators.

Failure to account for natural capital creates material financial risk. Companies reliant on stable water supplies, pollinator services, or fertile soils face stranded-asset scenarios as ecosystems degrade. The World Economic Forum's 2024 Global Risks Report ranked biodiversity loss and ecosystem collapse among the top five risks by severity over the next decade. NCA provides the data infrastructure to quantify these exposures before they become balance-sheet crises.

For governments, NCA informs land-use planning, infrastructure investment, and trade policy. Countries with robust natural capital accounts can identify where ecosystem degradation undermines long-term economic productivity and allocate restoration funding with greater precision. Without these accounts, policy decisions rely on incomplete data and short-term fiscal logic.

## How It Works / Key Components

NCA operates across two primary dimensions: physical accounts and monetary accounts. Physical accounts track the extent, condition, and change over time of natural assets — hectares of forest, cubic meters of freshwater, species population indices. Monetary accounts translate these physical stocks and flows into economic terms using valuation methodologies such as replacement cost, avoided damage, or market pricing for traded ecosystem goods.

The SEEA framework organizes accounts into thematic modules. Land accounts cover soil and terrestrial ecosystems. Water accounts track freshwater stocks, withdrawals, and returns. Energy and mineral accounts record sub-soil asset extraction. Ecosystem accounts — the most complex — map ecosystem types, assess condition using biophysical indicators, and estimate the monetary value of services those ecosystems provide to economic units.

At the corporate level, NCA typically involves natural capital assessments or dependencies-and-impacts analyses. A company maps its value chain, identifies where operations depend on or affect natural capital, quantifies those dependencies in physical terms, and then values them using established protocols like the Natural Capital Protocol published by the Capitals Coalition. This process reveals hidden risks — a beverage company's dependence on watershed health, for instance — and opportunities for value creation through ecosystem stewardship.

Technology has dramatically improved NCA feasibility. Remote sensing, satellite imagery, environmental DNA sampling, and AI-driven ecological modeling now allow physical accounting at scales and resolutions that were impossible a decade ago. The challenge has shifted from data collection to institutional adoption — embedding NCA into treasury functions, procurement decisions, and national statistical offices.

## Council Fire's Approach

Council Fire integrates natural capital thinking into climate resilience strategy, ocean governance, and sustainable business advisory. We help clients move beyond compliance-driven NCA toward strategic deployment — using natural capital data to identify investment opportunities in ecosystem restoration, strengthen supply chain resilience, and build credible narratives for investors and regulators operating under TNFD and EU Taxonomy frameworks.

## Frequently Asked Questions

### How does natural capital accounting differ from ESG reporting?
ESG reporting typically aggregates environmental metrics into disclosure frameworks for investors. NCA goes deeper — it quantifies specific ecosystem dependencies and impacts in physical and monetary terms, providing the granular data that underpins credible ESG disclosures. Think of NCA as the analytical engine and ESG reporting as one of its outputs.

### Is natural capital accounting mandatory for companies?
Not yet in most jurisdictions, though the regulatory trajectory is clear. The EU Corporate Sustainability Reporting Directive (CSRD) requires nature-related disclosures aligned with European Sustainability Reporting Standards. The TNFD recommendations, while voluntary, are rapidly becoming an investor expectation. Companies in sectors with high nature dependencies — agriculture, food and beverage, extractives, real estate — face the most immediate pressure.

### What are the main challenges in implementing NCA?
Valuation methodology remains contested — assigning monetary values to biodiversity or cultural ecosystem services involves inherent uncertainty. Data gaps persist, particularly in marine and subterranean ecosystems. Institutional capacity is limited in many countries and companies. And there is legitimate concern about commodification — reducing nature to economic units risks undervaluing intrinsic ecological worth. Effective NCA acknowledges these limitations while still providing decision-useful information.
