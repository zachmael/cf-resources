## What is Sustainability Assurance?

Sustainability assurance is the independent examination of an organization's sustainability-related disclosures by a qualified third party, resulting in a conclusion about the reliability and accuracy of reported information. Assurance engagements range from limited assurance (primarily inquiry and analytical procedures, resulting in a "nothing has come to our attention" negative conclusion) to reasonable assurance (the same level of rigor as a financial audit, resulting in a positive opinion on whether the information is fairly stated). The IAASB published ISSA 5000, the first global standard for sustainability assurance, in September 2024, establishing a comprehensive framework for assurance practitioners.

## Why It Matters

Sustainability assurance is the missing accountability layer that has allowed greenwashing to persist. For two decades, companies published sustainability reports with little or no external verification, enabling selective disclosure, favorable framing, and outright errors to go unchallenged. A 2023 study by Carbon Tracker found significant discrepancies between companies' self-reported emissions and independent estimates in the oil and gas sector. Without assurance, sustainability disclosure operates on an honor system that financial markets abandoned a century ago for financial reporting.

The regulatory mandate for sustainability assurance is now arriving rapidly. The CSRD requires limited assurance for all in-scope sustainability reports starting from the first reporting year (fiscal year 2024 for the largest companies), with a planned transition to reasonable assurance by 2028. The SEC climate rule requires third-party attestation of Scope 1 and 2 emissions for large accelerated filers. Japan, Australia, and other ISSB-adopting jurisdictions are incorporating assurance requirements into their sustainability reporting mandates. Within five years, sustainability assurance will be as routine as financial statement auditing for large public companies.

The market for sustainability assurance is booming and contested. The Big Four accounting firms—which already audit financial statements for most large companies—are aggressively building sustainability assurance practices, positioning themselves as natural providers given their existing audit relationships and quality management infrastructure. However, specialized sustainability assurance providers (Bureau Veritas, SGS, DNV, LRQA) have decades of experience in environmental and social verification. The CSRD allows both statutory auditors and independent assurance service providers to perform sustainability assurance, setting up a competitive market.

For companies, the transition to mandatory assurance means sustainability data must meet "assurance-ready" standards. This requires defined methodologies, documented processes, internal controls, audit trails, clear data ownership, and consistent application of measurement approaches. Companies that have treated sustainability reporting as an annual narrative exercise—rather than a rigorous data management discipline—face significant readiness gaps that take 12–24 months to close.

## How It Works / Key Components

ISSA 5000 (General Requirements for Sustainability Assurance Engagements) provides the authoritative framework. It applies to assurance engagements on sustainability information reported under any framework—ESRS, ISSB, GRI, CDP, or proprietary frameworks. The standard covers engagement acceptance, planning, risk assessment, evidence gathering, evaluation, and reporting. It requires the assurance practitioner to understand the entity's sustainability reporting processes, assess risks of material misstatement, design and perform procedures to address those risks, and form a conclusion.

Limited assurance—the starting point under CSRD—involves primarily inquiry and analytical procedures. The practitioner asks management about data collection processes, reviews documentation of methodologies, performs analytical comparisons (e.g., are emissions changes consistent with known operational changes?), and evaluates the plausibility of reported information. The resulting conclusion is expressed negatively: "Based on our procedures, nothing has come to our attention that causes us to believe the sustainability information is materially misstated."

Reasonable assurance—the eventual CSRD target—requires substantially more evidence. The practitioner tests data at the source level, inspects supporting documentation, performs recalculations, evaluates management estimates and assumptions, and obtains sufficient appropriate evidence to form a positive opinion: "In our opinion, the sustainability information is fairly stated in all material respects in accordance with [applicable framework]." The level of testing and evidence gathering approaches that of a financial statement audit, with corresponding cost implications.

Key challenges in sustainability assurance include the diversity of subject matter (assuring a GHG inventory requires different expertise than assuring human rights due diligence), the prevalence of estimates and assumptions (particularly for Scope 3 emissions and forward-looking statements), the immaturity of internal controls over sustainability data (compared to decades of financial reporting controls), and the need for multi-disciplinary assurance teams (combining accounting, environmental science, social science, and engineering expertise). These challenges are driving significant investment in assurance methodology development, practitioner training, and technology solutions.

## Council Fire's Approach

Council Fire prepares clients for sustainability assurance by building the internal infrastructure that assurance requires: defined data collection methodologies, documented processes and internal controls, audit-trail-ready data management systems, and clear ownership and accountability for sustainability metrics. We work with clients before their assurance provider engages, ensuring the organization is assurance-ready and that the first engagement proceeds smoothly rather than surfacing systemic data quality issues that delay reporting.

## Frequently Asked Questions

### What's the difference between limited and reasonable assurance?

Limited assurance provides a moderate level of confidence through primarily inquiry and analytical procedures—the practitioner concludes that nothing indicates material misstatement, but the work performed is less extensive than a full audit. Reasonable assurance provides a high level of confidence through detailed testing, inspection, and evidence gathering—the practitioner positively opines that the information is fairly stated. The key practical difference is cost and effort: reasonable assurance typically costs 2–3x more than limited assurance and requires companies to maintain more robust internal controls and documentation. The CSRD begins with limited assurance to allow companies to build their capabilities before the transition to reasonable assurance.

### Who can perform sustainability assurance?

Under the CSRD, both statutory auditors and "independent assurance services providers" (IASPs) accredited by member states can perform sustainability assurance. The Big Four firms perform sustainability assurance through their audit practices. Specialized providers like Bureau Veritas, SGS, DNV, and LRQA bring deep subject-matter expertise in environmental and social verification. The choice depends on your priorities: using your financial statement auditor may offer efficiency through existing knowledge of the business and integrated audit planning, while specialized providers may offer deeper sustainability technical expertise. ISSA 5000 applies to all practitioners regardless of background, establishing common quality requirements.

### How should my company prepare for mandatory sustainability assurance?

Start with a readiness assessment 12–18 months before your first assurance engagement. Key preparation steps: document all data collection methodologies and measurement approaches; establish internal controls over sustainability data comparable to financial reporting controls; create audit trails from reported metrics back to source data; assign clear ownership and accountability for each data stream; reconcile sustainability data with financial data where they overlap (e.g., energy costs versus energy consumption); perform internal "dry run" testing of key metrics; and engage your intended assurance provider early for a pre-assurance gap assessment. Companies that invest in readiness avoid the costly and reputation-damaging scenario of an assurance provider identifying material weaknesses during the engagement itself.
