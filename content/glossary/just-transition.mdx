## What is Just Transition?

A just transition is a framework for ensuring that the economic and social consequences of decarbonization are distributed fairly—that workers, communities, and regions dependent on fossil fuel industries are not abandoned as the global economy shifts toward clean energy. Rooted in the labor movement and formalized in the Paris Agreement's preamble, the concept recognizes that climate action, while essential, will create winners and losers unless deliberate policies are implemented to support affected populations. A just transition encompasses workforce retraining, economic diversification, social safety nets, community investment, and meaningful participation of affected stakeholders in planning their own futures.

## Why It Matters

The scale of economic disruption from decarbonization is immense. The International Labour Organization estimates that the transition to a green economy will create 24 million new jobs globally by 2030—but will also eliminate 6 million existing jobs, primarily in fossil fuel extraction, processing, and combustion-dependent industries. The net gain obscures severe regional concentration: coal mining communities in Appalachia, oil-dependent economies in the Gulf states, and fossil fuel workers in developing nations face existential threats to their economic foundations.

History offers cautionary tales. The decline of the UK coal industry in the 1980s and 1990s, conducted without meaningful transition support, devastated communities across Wales, Yorkshire, and Scotland. Unemployment rates in former coalfields remained elevated for decades, health outcomes deteriorated, and social cohesion eroded. The Ruhr Valley in Germany, by contrast, invested billions in economic diversification, retraining, and cultural regeneration over 40 years—transforming a coal and steel region into a center for technology, education, and clean energy. The difference was not inevitable decline versus resilience; it was policy choice.

The political dimension cannot be overstated. Climate policy without just transition provisions generates backlash that undermines the pace and ambition of decarbonization itself. France's gilets jaunes protests, sparked by a fuel tax increase perceived as regressive, demonstrated how climate policies that ignore distributional impacts can provoke fierce opposition. Conversely, the U.S. Inflation Reduction Act (2022) explicitly targets clean energy investments in "energy communities"—census tracts with closed coal mines or retired coal-fired power plants—channeling economic benefits to the places most affected by the transition.

The financial sector increasingly recognizes just transition as a material consideration. The Grantham Research Institute estimates that $1–2 trillion in fossil fuel assets face stranding risk by 2035, with concentrated impacts on specific communities and pension funds. The Climate Action 100+ investor coalition has incorporated just transition into its engagement framework, and the Glasgow Financial Alliance for Net Zero acknowledges that transition plans must address social impacts to be credible and durable.

## How It Works / Key Components

Just transition strategies operate across three dimensions: workforce, community, and governance. Workforce interventions include skills assessment and retraining programs, wage insurance during career transitions, early retirement provisions, and job placement services. Germany's coal phase-out legislation (2020) provides a model: the Coal Regions Investment Act allocates €40 billion through 2038 to affected regions, including funding for infrastructure, research institutions, and federal agency relocations. Individual miners receive Anpassungsgeld (adjustment payments) bridging the gap to pension eligibility.

Community-level strategies address the broader economic base. Fossil fuel regions typically suffer from industrial monoculture—economic dependency on a single sector that leaves communities vulnerable to decline. Diversification requires investment in infrastructure (broadband, transportation, education facilities), business development support, and anchor institution strategies that create new sources of employment. The Appalachian Regional Commission's POWER Initiative has funded over 400 projects across coal-impacted communities, supporting healthcare, tourism, technology, and renewable energy development.

Governance frameworks ensure that affected communities have meaningful voice in transition planning. The International Labour Organization's Guidelines for a Just Transition emphasize social dialogue—structured engagement between governments, employers, and workers' organizations. Scotland's Just Transition Commission, established in 2019, includes labor, industry, environmental, and community representatives and advises the government on transition policy. The EU's Just Transition Mechanism requires member states to develop Territorial Just Transition Plans through stakeholder engagement processes.

Implementation requires long lead times and sustained commitment. Workforce retraining takes years, not months. Economic diversification takes decades, not years. Communities that have built their identity around an industry need time and resources to reimagine their futures. Policymakers who treat just transition as an afterthought—announcing plant closures before support programs are in place—undermine both the affected communities and the broader political sustainability of climate action.

## Council Fire's Approach

Council Fire advises organizations and governments on just transition strategies that integrate economic diversification, workforce development, and community engagement with climate and sustainability goals. Our work in climate resilience informs our understanding that communities facing fossil fuel transition are often simultaneously exposed to physical climate risks—flooding, heat, sea level rise—requiring integrated approaches that address both economic transition and climate adaptation. We help clients design stakeholder engagement processes that center the voices of affected workers and communities, ensuring transition plans are both effective and legitimate.

## Frequently Asked Questions

### What does a successful just transition look like in practice?

The Ruhr Valley in Germany offers the most comprehensive example. Over four decades, the region transitioned from coal and steel dominance to a diversified economy centered on technology, higher education, logistics, and clean energy. Key ingredients included sustained public investment (€3.5 billion through the International Building Exhibition alone), establishment of 22 universities and research institutions in the region, brownfield remediation and cultural repurposing of industrial sites, and continuous social dialogue between government, industry, and labor. The region still faces challenges—unemployment remains above the German average—but the transformation prevented the social collapse seen in other post-industrial regions. More recently, Spain's 2018 Agreement for a Just Transition for coal mining includes early retirement provisions, environmental restoration employment, and renewable energy development priorities for coal regions.

### How is the Inflation Reduction Act addressing just transition in the United States?

The IRA channels clean energy investment toward affected communities through several mechanisms. Energy Community Tax Credit Bonuses provide a 10% adder for clean energy projects located in census tracts with closed coal mines or retired power plants. The $27 billion Greenhouse Gas Reduction Fund prioritizes investment in low-income and disadvantaged communities. Direct Pay provisions enable municipalities and nonprofits in coal regions to access clean energy tax credits without tax liability. The Advanced Manufacturing Production Credit incentivizes domestic supply chain development, creating manufacturing jobs that can absorb displaced workers. Early implementation data shows significant clean energy investment flowing to coal-impacted counties, though the scale of workforce transition support remains below what labor organizations and community advocates have requested.

### Who is responsible for funding just transition?

Responsibility is shared across governments, industry, and the financial sector. Governments provide the policy framework, public investment, and social safety nets. The EU's Just Transition Fund allocates €17.5 billion for the 2021–2027 period, supplemented by member state co-financing. Industry bears responsibility through negotiated transition agreements, workforce retraining investments, and site remediation. The financial sector is increasingly expected to integrate just transition considerations into lending and investment decisions—the International Platform on Sustainable Finance published guidance in 2022 on incorporating social considerations into transition finance taxonomies. Multilateral development banks, including the World Bank and Asian Development Bank, fund just transition programs in developing nations where domestic resources are insufficient.
