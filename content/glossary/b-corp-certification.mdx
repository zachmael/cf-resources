## What is B Corp Certification?

B Corp certification is a private certification issued by B Lab, a nonprofit organization, to companies that meet rigorous standards of verified social and environmental performance, public transparency, and legal accountability. Certified B Corporations must score 80 or above (out of 200) on the B Impact Assessment, pass a risk review, and amend their legal governing documents to require consideration of all stakeholders—not just shareholders—in corporate decision-making. As of early 2026, over 8,500 companies across 96 countries and 161 industries hold the certification.

## Why It Matters

B Corp certification addresses a credibility gap that undermines corporate sustainability claims. In a landscape saturated with ESG ratings, sustainability reports, and purpose statements, B Corp provides third-party verification that a company's practices match its rhetoric. The certification is holistic—evaluating governance structures, worker treatment, community impact, environmental performance, and customer impact—rather than focusing on a single dimension of corporate responsibility.

The rigor of the assessment is what distinguishes B Corp from less demanding certifications. The median score for ordinary businesses taking the B Impact Assessment is approximately 50 out of 200; the 80-point threshold requires demonstrable excellence across multiple impact categories. The assessment is updated every three years, and certified companies must recertify on a three-year cycle, ensuring continuous improvement rather than one-time compliance.

For consumers and business buyers, B Corp certification functions as a trust signal. Nielsen research has consistently shown that consumers are willing to pay premiums for products from companies they perceive as socially responsible, but translating that perception into purchasing behavior requires credible verification. B Corp logos appear on products from Patagonia, Ben & Jerry's, Allbirds, and thousands of smaller companies, creating a recognizable standard that reduces information asymmetry.

The investment community increasingly uses B Corp status as an input to due diligence. Private equity firms including Bridges Fund Management and impact-focused venture funds use B Corp certification as both a sourcing filter and a portfolio management tool. Several studies have found that B Corps demonstrate stronger employee retention, customer loyalty, and revenue growth than matched non-certified peers, suggesting that the certification captures something real about organizational health and resilience.

## How It Works / Key Components

The certification process begins with the B Impact Assessment (BIA), a comprehensive questionnaire covering five impact areas: governance, workers, community, environment, and customers. Questions are tailored to company size, sector, and geography, with scoring weighted accordingly. A midsized manufacturing company, for example, faces different environmental questions than a professional services firm. The assessment takes most companies 60-120 hours to complete and requires supporting documentation.

After completing the BIA and achieving a qualifying score, companies undergo B Lab's review process, which includes document verification, site visits for larger companies, and a risk assessment covering controversies, legal issues, and sensitive industry exposure. Companies in extractive industries, firearms manufacturing, and certain other sectors face additional scrutiny or exclusion.

The legal requirement is a distinguishing feature. In jurisdictions where benefit corporation legislation exists, B Corps must adopt benefit corporation legal status within a specified timeframe. Where such legislation is unavailable, companies must amend their articles of incorporation or equivalent documents to embed stakeholder consideration into their legal DNA. This requirement ensures that B Corp certification is not merely a marketing overlay but a structural commitment enforceable by shareholders and directors.

Recertification every three years maintains accountability. B Lab has not hesitated to revoke certification from companies that fail to recertify or whose practices fall below standards—including high-profile cases that generated significant media attention. The standards themselves evolve; B Lab announced in 2024 a comprehensive revision of its standards framework, moving toward industry-specific performance requirements and strengthening climate-related criteria in response to stakeholder feedback.

## Frequently Asked Questions

### What is the difference between a B Corp and a benefit corporation?

B Corp is a private certification issued by B Lab based on verified performance standards. A benefit corporation is a legal corporate structure authorized by state legislation that permits (or requires) directors to consider stakeholder interests. They are complementary but distinct. A company can be a certified B Corp without being a legally registered benefit corporation (though B Lab requires movement toward legal accountability), and a company can register as a benefit corporation without pursuing B Corp certification. The strongest commitment involves both: certified performance verified by B Lab within a legal structure that embeds stakeholder governance.

### How much does B Corp certification cost?

Annual certification fees are scaled to company revenue. Companies with less than $150,000 in annual revenue pay $1,000 per year. Fees increase on a graduated scale up to $50,000 or more annually for companies with revenues exceeding $1 billion. The direct fee, however, is typically the smallest cost. The operational investment—staff time to complete the assessment, legal costs for governance amendments, and potential changes to policies and practices needed to reach the 80-point threshold—varies widely but can represent a significant commitment, particularly for companies starting far below the qualifying score.

### Has B Corp certification faced criticism?

Yes, and the criticism has sharpened the system. The most significant challenge came with the certification of large multinationals whose subsidiaries certified while parent companies maintained practices inconsistent with B Corp values. B Lab has responded by tightening its approach to subsidiary certification and introducing more rigorous parent company reviews. Critics also note that the 80-point threshold, while rigorous relative to average companies, still allows certification for companies with significant weaknesses in one area if they score highly in others. B Lab's ongoing standards revision process aims to address this through sector-specific minimum requirements. The broader critique—that voluntary certification cannot substitute for regulation—is valid but somewhat misplaced; B Corp was never intended to replace public policy but to identify companies operating ahead of regulatory floors.
