## What is Water Footprint?

A water footprint measures the total volume of freshwater used to produce goods and services, calculated across three components: blue water (surface and groundwater consumed), green water (rainwater consumed, primarily in agriculture), and grey water (the volume of freshwater required to assimilate pollutants to meet water quality standards). Developed by Arjen Hoekstra at the University of Twente, the water footprint concept is operationalized through the Water Footprint Network's assessment methodology and ISO 14046 (water footprint assessment standard).

## Why It Matters

Water footprinting reveals hidden water dependencies that conventional metrics miss. A cotton t-shirt requires approximately 2,700 liters of water to produce. A kilogram of beef requires roughly 15,400 liters. A cup of coffee, 140 liters. These figures include water used across the entire supply chain—from irrigating cotton fields to processing fabric, from growing feed grain to raising cattle. Without footprint analysis, companies remain blind to the water embedded in their products and supply chains.

Geographic context transforms raw footprint numbers into risk information. Consuming 1,000 liters of water in water-abundant Scandinavia has fundamentally different implications than consuming the same volume in water-scarce Pakistan. Volumetric water footprints become decision-relevant when combined with water stress indicators, enabling companies to prioritize reduction efforts where they matter most—in water-stressed basins.

CDP reports that 69% of companies responding to their water security questionnaire identified water as a substantive business risk. Water footprinting provides the analytical foundation for understanding where those risks originate. Companies that map their water footprint across supply chain tiers can identify hotspots, engage suppliers in water-stressed regions, and build resilience before crises emerge.

Regulatory and customer requirements increasingly demand water footprint disclosure. The EU's Product Environmental Footprint methodology includes water use as a mandatory impact category. Consumer goods companies face pressure from retailers like Walmart and Tesco to disclose supply chain water performance. Agricultural certification schemes (Better Cotton, Rainforest Alliance) include water stewardship requirements.

## How It Works / Key Components

Blue water footprint measures consumptive use of surface and groundwater—water withdrawn from the environment and not returned to the same catchment in the same period. This is the component most directly linked to water scarcity, as it reduces availability for other users and ecosystems. Irrigation is the dominant source of blue water footprints in agricultural supply chains.

Green water footprint measures rainwater consumed through evapotranspiration in crop production and forestry. While not drawing on blue water resources, green water is a finite resource—land used for one crop cannot capture rainfall for another. Green water footprints are most relevant for land-use decisions and agricultural planning.

Grey water footprint quantifies the freshwater required to dilute pollutants to acceptable concentrations. A factory discharging nitrogen-rich wastewater requires a grey water volume calculated from pollutant load and receiving water quality standards. Grey water footprints highlight pollution impacts that volumetric withdrawal figures miss.

Water footprint assessment follows four phases: setting goals and scope, accounting (quantifying the footprint), sustainability assessment (evaluating whether the footprint is sustainable given local conditions), and response formulation (identifying reduction opportunities and actions). The assessment can be applied to products, organizations, geographic areas, or entire supply chains.

## Council Fire's Approach

Council Fire conducts water footprint assessments that combine volumetric measurement with water stress context to generate actionable insights. We help clients identify supply chain water hotspots, prioritize interventions in water-stressed basins, and integrate water footprint data into product development, procurement, and disclosure processes.

## Frequently Asked Questions

### What is the difference between water footprint and water withdrawal?
Water withdrawal measures water taken from a source; water footprint measures total consumption (water not returned) plus dilution requirements for pollutants, across the entire supply chain. A company's water footprint is almost always much larger than its direct withdrawals because it includes upstream supply chain water use.

### Which products have the largest water footprints?
Animal products consistently rank highest: beef (~15,400 L/kg), sheep meat (~10,400 L/kg), pork (~6,000 L/kg). Among crops, rice (~2,500 L/kg), cotton (~10,000 L/kg for raw cotton), and coffee (~18,900 L/kg for roasted beans) have large footprints. However, impact depends on where the water is sourced—the same crop in a water-abundant vs. water-scarce region carries different risk implications.

### How can companies reduce their water footprint?
Strategies include: improving irrigation efficiency in agricultural supply chains, switching to less water-intensive raw materials, reducing water pollution (lowering grey water footprint), sourcing from water-abundant regions, investing in water recycling and reuse, and engaging suppliers in water stewardship programs.
