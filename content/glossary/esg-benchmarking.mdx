## What is ESG Benchmarking?

ESG benchmarking is the systematic comparison of an organization's environmental, social, and governance performance against peers, industry standards, or best-practice thresholds. It transforms raw ESG data into contextual intelligence—answering not just "what is our carbon intensity?" but "how does our carbon intensity compare to our sector, our competitors, and the trajectory needed to meet Paris Agreement goals?"

## Why It Matters

ESG performance without context is just data. A company reporting 50,000 tonnes of CO₂e means nothing in isolation—it could be exemplary for a steel producer or alarming for a software company. Benchmarking provides the comparative frame that investors, boards, and management need to evaluate whether performance is adequate, improving, or falling behind. MSCI, Sustainalytics, and CDP all benchmark companies against sector peers; companies that understand where they stand can manage their positioning proactively rather than reacting to external ratings.

Investor expectations have sharpened this need. BlackRock, State Street, and other major asset managers explicitly compare portfolio companies against sector peers on material ESG topics. A company in the third quartile for emissions intensity within its sector faces harder questions at AGMs, lower ESG scores, and potential exclusion from sustainability-themed funds. Understanding your benchmarking position is no longer optional for investor-facing companies.

Benchmarking also drives internal performance improvement. When facility managers see their energy intensity ranked against comparable sites within the organization and across the industry, it creates accountability and surfaces best practices for transfer. Companies that benchmark at the site level—not just the corporate level—consistently identify efficiency opportunities that aggregate into meaningful performance gains.

The regulatory dimension is emerging too. ESRS requires companies to contextualize certain disclosures—for instance, reporting Scope 1 and 2 emissions alongside the transition plan needed to align with a 1.5°C pathway. This is essentially benchmarking against a science-derived standard. Companies that already benchmark against SBTi pathways, sector decarbonization targets, and peer performance are better prepared for this requirement.

## How It Works / Key Components

**Peer group definition** determines who you're comparing against. This involves selecting companies based on industry classification (GICS, NACE), size, geography, and business model similarity. The peer group should be defensible and relevant—comparing a diversified industrial conglomerate against pure-play competitors in one segment produces misleading results. Most organizations define multiple peer groups for different purposes: sector peers for emissions benchmarking, regional peers for social metrics, and best-in-class leaders for aspiration-setting.

**Metric selection and normalization** ensures apples-to-apples comparisons. Absolute metrics (total emissions, total water withdrawal) reflect overall impact but penalize larger companies. Intensity metrics (emissions per revenue, water per unit of production, TRIR per hours worked) enable fairer comparison across different-sized organizations. The choice of normalization factor matters—revenue-based intensity can be distorted by pricing power, while production-based intensity requires comparable product definitions.

**Data sourcing** aggregates peer performance data from public sustainability reports, CDP disclosures, ESG rating agency datasets, and industry databases. SASB/ISSB's industry-specific metrics are particularly useful for benchmarking because they define comparable metrics across sectors. Third-party data providers like Bloomberg ESG, Refinitiv, and S&P Global Sustainable1 offer pre-compiled peer datasets, though data quality and coverage vary.

**Analysis and target-setting** translates benchmarking results into action. Gap analysis identifies areas of underperformance and their root causes. Target-setting uses benchmarking to establish ambitious but credible goals—top quartile performance, year-over-year improvement trajectories, or alignment with external standards like SBTi. The most effective benchmarking programs embed results into performance management systems, linking ESG benchmarking outcomes to executive incentives and capital allocation decisions.

## Council Fire's Approach

Council Fire conducts ESG benchmarking analyses that go beyond ranking tables to deliver actionable insights. We define defensible peer groups, normalize metrics for fair comparison, identify performance gaps and root causes, and translate findings into improvement priorities and target-setting frameworks—helping clients understand where they stand and what it takes to lead.

## Frequently Asked Questions

### How do we benchmark when peers don't disclose comparable data?
This is the most common benchmarking challenge, particularly for social and governance metrics. Strategies include: using CDP and ESG rating agency databases that estimate missing data; focusing on metrics where disclosure rates are highest (Scope 1 and 2 emissions, safety rates, board diversity); leveraging industry initiatives that publish aggregated benchmarks (IPIECA for oil and gas, ICMM for mining); and disclosing your own methodology so peers can benchmark against you.

### Should we use absolute or intensity metrics for benchmarking?
Use both. Absolute metrics matter for planetary boundaries—total emissions drive climate change regardless of intensity improvements. Intensity metrics are essential for fair peer comparison and operational efficiency tracking. The best benchmarking programs report absolute performance for impact context and intensity metrics for competitive positioning. SBTi requires absolute emission reductions for most target approaches, regardless of intensity improvements.

### How often should ESG benchmarking be updated?
Annual benchmarking aligned with reporting cycles is the minimum. Quarterly or semi-annual updates are valuable for metrics where more frequent data is available (energy, safety, employee engagement). Real-time benchmarking is emerging for energy and emissions through platforms that connect to smart meters and utility data. The appropriate frequency depends on the metric's volatility and the organization's capacity to act on updated insights.
