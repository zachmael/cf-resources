## What is a Carbon Footprint?

A carbon footprint is the total greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions caused directly and indirectly by an organization, product, event, or individual, expressed as carbon dioxide equivalent (CO₂e). For organizations, it typically encompasses Scope 1 (direct emissions from owned or controlled sources), Scope 2 (indirect emissions from purchased energy), and Scope 3 (all other indirect emissions across the value chain), as defined by the GHG Protocol Corporate Standard.

## Why It Matters

Understanding your carbon footprint is the prerequisite for managing it. You cannot set credible reduction targets, develop decarbonization strategies, or report meaningful progress without a robust, complete emissions inventory. The GHG Protocol—the most widely used corporate accounting standard, applied by over 90% of Fortune 500 companies that report emissions—provides the methodology, but execution requires systematic data collection, calculation rigor, and consistent boundary definitions.

Regulatory requirements have made carbon footprint measurement non-negotiable. The CSRD mandates disclosure of Scope 1, 2, and 3 emissions under ESRS E1 (Climate Change). ISSB's IFRS S2 requires the same. The SEC's climate disclosure rules (to the extent they survive legal challenge) focus on Scope 1 and 2, with Scope 3 for large accelerated filers when material. Carbon footprint data is also the foundation for science-based targets, carbon pricing exposure analysis, and climate-related financial risk assessment.

The Scope 3 dimension makes carbon footprinting particularly challenging—and particularly valuable. CDP's 2023 analysis found that supply chain emissions average 11.4 times direct operational emissions for reporting companies. For sectors like financial services, retail, and technology, Scope 3 often represents over 90% of the total footprint. Companies that measure only Scope 1 and 2 may be accounting for less than 10% of their actual climate impact.

From a strategic perspective, carbon footprint data reveals decarbonization opportunities. Granular emissions inventories—broken down by facility, process, product line, and value chain category—identify the highest-impact reduction levers. A manufacturer might discover that a single production process accounts for 40% of Scope 1 emissions, or that business travel generates more emissions than its entire logistics operation. These insights drive targeted, cost-effective decarbonization strategies.

## How It Works / Key Components

**Organizational boundary setting** defines which entities and operations are included in the footprint. The GHG Protocol offers two approaches: equity share (emissions proportional to ownership stake) and operational control (100% of emissions from operations the company controls). The choice affects reported totals significantly for companies with joint ventures, franchises, or minority-owned subsidiaries. Consistency across reporting periods is essential for meaningful trend analysis.

**Scope 1 calculation** covers direct emissions from owned or controlled sources: combustion of fuels in boilers, furnaces, and vehicles; process emissions from chemical reactions; fugitive emissions from refrigerant leaks or methane from pipelines. Calculation uses activity data (fuel consumed, refrigerant recharged) multiplied by emission factors (kg CO₂e per unit of activity). Data sources include fuel purchase records, meter readings, and equipment maintenance logs.

**Scope 2 calculation** addresses indirect emissions from purchased electricity, steam, heating, and cooling. The GHG Protocol Scope 2 Guidance requires dual reporting: location-based (using grid-average emission factors) and market-based (reflecting contractual instruments like renewable energy certificates, power purchase agreements, or supplier-specific factors). The difference between these two figures reveals the actual impact of renewable energy procurement decisions.

**Scope 3 calculation** covers the remaining 15 categories of indirect emissions, from purchased goods and services through end-of-life treatment of sold products. Methodologies range from spend-based estimates (using economic input-output factors) to activity-based calculations (using supplier-specific data). The GHG Protocol Scope 3 Standard and accompanying calculation guidance provide the framework, but practical implementation requires significant data gathering, supplier engagement, and methodological judgment.

## Council Fire's Approach

Council Fire conducts carbon footprint assessments that meet GHG Protocol standards, satisfy CSRD and ISSB disclosure requirements, and—critically—produce actionable data for decarbonization planning. We build emissions inventories from the ground up, establish calculation methodologies that can be sustained internally, and identify the highest-impact reduction opportunities across Scopes 1, 2, and 3.

## Frequently Asked Questions

### What emission factors should we use?
The choice depends on your geography and reporting requirements. Widely used databases include DEFRA (UK government, updated annually), EPA (US), IEA (global electricity factors), and ecoinvent (lifecycle assessment database). For Scope 2, location-based factors typically come from national grid operators or the IEA; market-based factors from energy suppliers or residual mix calculations. ESRS and ISSB don't prescribe specific databases but require disclosure of which factors were used.

### How accurate are Scope 3 estimates?
Accuracy varies dramatically by category and methodology. Categories based on fuel and energy (Category 3) or employee commuting surveys (Category 7) can be reasonably precise. Spend-based estimates for purchased goods and services (Category 1) may carry uncertainty ranges of ±50% or more. The key is transparency: disclose your methodology, data sources, and known limitations. Over time, shift from spend-based estimates to activity-based and supplier-specific data for your most material Scope 3 categories.

### How often should a carbon footprint be updated?
Annual calculation aligned with reporting cycles is the standard. However, many organizations benefit from quarterly or monthly tracking for Scope 1 and 2 emissions to support operational decision-making and early identification of performance trends. Scope 3, given its data collection complexity, is typically annual but should be recalculated whenever significant changes occur—new suppliers, product launches, major shifts in business travel patterns, or M&A activity.
