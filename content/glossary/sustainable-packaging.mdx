## What is Sustainable Packaging?

Sustainable packaging is the development and use of packaging solutions that minimize environmental impact across the full lifecycle—from material sourcing and manufacturing through distribution, use, and end-of-life management. It encompasses material selection (recycled, renewable, or biodegradable content), design optimization (lightweighting, right-sizing, eliminating unnecessary layers), system compatibility (designed for existing recycling or composting infrastructure), and supply chain efficiency (reducing damage, extending shelf life, optimizing logistics). The Sustainable Packaging Coalition defines it as packaging that is sourced responsibly, designed to be effective and safe, meets market criteria for performance and cost, and is recovered efficiently after use.

## Why It Matters

Packaging accounts for approximately 36% of all plastics produced globally, making it the single largest application of plastic materials. The Ellen MacArthur Foundation estimates that 95% of plastic packaging material value—$80–$120 billion annually—is lost after a single use. Packaging waste constitutes a significant share of marine debris; an estimated 11 million metric tonnes of plastic enter the ocean annually, with single-use packaging representing the largest identified category in coastal cleanups conducted by the Ocean Conservancy.

Regulatory action is reshaping the packaging landscape. The EU Packaging and Packaging Waste Regulation (PPWR), adopted in 2024, mandates minimum recycled content (30% for plastic packaging by 2030, rising to 65% by 2040), recyclability requirements for all packaging by 2030, and bans on specific single-use formats. Extended producer responsibility (EPR) schemes now operate in over 40 countries, requiring producers to fund the collection, sorting, and recycling of their packaging. France, Spain, and the Netherlands have implemented plastic packaging taxes.

Consumer demand has shifted decisively. A 2024 Trivium Packaging survey found that 82% of consumers are willing to pay more for sustainable packaging, up from 64% in 2020. Retailer requirements amplify this pressure—Walmart, Amazon, Target, and Tesco all impose packaging sustainability requirements on suppliers, encompassing recyclability, recycled content, and elimination of problematic materials.

The business case extends beyond compliance and consumer preference. Lightweighting reduces material costs and shipping expenses. Right-sizing eliminates void fill and reduces package counts per pallet. Standardized recyclable formats simplify waste management and reduce disposal costs. Companies like Loop Industries, Novamont, and Notpla are building substantial businesses on packaging innovation, demonstrating that sustainable packaging is a growth sector, not merely a cost center.

## How It Works / Key Components

Material selection is the foundational decision. Options include recycled plastics (rPET, rHDPE), paper and cardboard from certified sustainable forestry (FSC, PEFC), bio-based plastics (PLA, PHA), compostable materials, glass, aluminum, and steel. Each material carries distinct environmental profiles, performance characteristics, infrastructure compatibility, and cost implications. The optimal choice depends on product requirements, distribution channels, and the waste management infrastructure available in target markets.

Design for recyclability ensures that packaging can actually be recovered after use. This means avoiding multi-material laminates that cannot be separated, using inks and adhesives compatible with recycling processes, ensuring labels can be removed or are made from the same material as the container, and conforming to design guidelines published by organizations like CEFLEX (for flexible packaging) and the Association of Plastic Recyclers. Design for recyclability is meaningless without actual recycling infrastructure, making system-level thinking essential.

Packaging optimization reduces material use without compromising product protection. Finite element analysis, computational fluid dynamics, and real-world performance testing enable engineers to remove material from non-critical areas while reinforcing stress points. Amazon's Frustration-Free Packaging program has eliminated over 1.5 million tonnes of packaging material since inception by certifying that products can ship in their own packaging without an outer box.

End-of-life systems close the loop. These include curbside recycling, deposit return schemes (which achieve collection rates above 90% in countries like Germany and Norway), industrial composting for certified compostable packaging, and reuse systems (refillable containers, returnables logistics). The choice of end-of-life pathway must be designed in from the start—a compostable package that enters the recycling stream contaminates the process, and a recyclable package that reaches a market without recycling infrastructure ends up in landfill.

## Council Fire's Approach

Council Fire advises organizations on sustainable packaging strategy that addresses regulatory compliance, consumer expectations, and environmental impact—with particular attention to ocean pollution prevention and marine ecosystem protection. We help clients navigate material transitions, design for circularity, and engage with the infrastructure and policy developments that determine whether sustainable packaging claims translate into real-world environmental outcomes.

## Frequently Asked Questions

### Is biodegradable packaging actually better for the environment?

Not necessarily. "Biodegradable" means a material will break down under certain conditions, but those conditions may not exist in practice. Many biodegradable plastics require industrial composting facilities operating at 58°C or higher—they will not degrade in landfills, oceans, or backyard compost bins. If biodegradable packaging enters the recycling stream, it contaminates conventional plastic recycling. The environmental benefit depends entirely on whether appropriate end-of-life infrastructure is available and accessible to end users.

### What is extended producer responsibility (EPR) for packaging?

EPR schemes require companies that place packaging on the market to finance the collection, sorting, and recycling of that packaging after consumer use. Producers typically pay fees to a producer responsibility organization (PRO) based on the weight, material type, and recyclability of their packaging. Well-designed EPR systems incentivize packaging reduction and recyclability by modulating fees—recyclable packaging costs less than non-recyclable, and lighter packaging costs less than heavier. EPR operates in over 40 countries and is expanding to additional markets including the U.S. at the state level.

### How do companies choose between recycled content and bio-based packaging materials?

The decision depends on material availability, performance requirements, cost, and end-of-life infrastructure. Recycled content (particularly rPET and recycled cardboard) benefits from established collection and processing systems but faces supply constraints as demand grows. Bio-based materials reduce fossil fuel dependence and may offer compostability, but production competes for agricultural land and composting infrastructure remains limited. Many companies adopt portfolio approaches—using recycled content where supply chains are mature and bio-based materials where specific performance characteristics (barrier properties, compostability) justify the transition.
