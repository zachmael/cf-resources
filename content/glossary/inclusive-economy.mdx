## What is an Inclusive Economy?

An inclusive economy is one in which economic opportunity, participation, and benefits are broadly shared across all segments of society, rather than concentrated among a narrow elite. It encompasses equitable access to quality employment, education, healthcare, financial services, digital infrastructure, and asset ownership. The concept extends beyond income distribution to structural inclusion—ensuring that historically marginalized groups have voice, agency, and genuine pathways to economic participation. The Rockefeller Foundation, the OECD, and the World Economic Forum have each advanced frameworks for measuring economic inclusivity, reflecting growing consensus that growth without inclusion is neither sustainable nor stable.

## Why It Matters

Inequality is no longer an abstract concern for development economists—it is a material risk to businesses and financial markets. The World Economic Forum has ranked inequality and social instability among the top five global risks by likelihood for eight consecutive years. IMF research demonstrates that more equal societies grow faster and more sustainably; a 2024 IMF working paper found that a one-percentage-point increase in the income share of the bottom 20% is associated with 0.38 percentage points of additional GDP growth over five years.

For corporations, exclusion manifests as constrained consumer markets, talent pipeline limitations, operational disruptions, and reputational damage. Companies operating in communities with high inequality face elevated security costs, workforce instability, and regulatory risk. Conversely, businesses that expand access—through inclusive hiring, affordable products, supplier diversity, and community investment—build larger addressable markets and more resilient operations.

The ESG framework increasingly captures inclusivity. The "S" in ESG, long considered the weakest pillar in terms of measurement rigor, is being strengthened by new disclosure requirements. The EU's Corporate Sustainability Reporting Directive mandates reporting on workforce diversity, living wages, and community impact. The SEC's human capital disclosure requirements, while less prescriptive, have prompted companies to provide more granular data on workforce composition and equity practices.

Climate change intensifies the urgency. Climate impacts fall disproportionately on low-income communities, communities of color, and developing nations—the populations least responsible for emissions and least equipped to adapt. An inclusive economy framework applied to climate policy ensures that transition costs do not exacerbate existing inequalities and that the economic opportunities of decarbonization are broadly distributed.

## How It Works / Key Components

Building an inclusive economy requires action across four interconnected domains: access, participation, equity, and resilience. Access refers to the availability of essential services and infrastructure—financial services for the unbanked, broadband for rural communities, affordable housing in high-opportunity areas. The World Bank estimates that 1.4 billion adults remain unbanked globally; mobile money platforms like M-Pesa have demonstrated that technology can dramatically expand financial access when paired with appropriate regulation.

Participation encompasses workforce inclusion, entrepreneurship support, and representation in decision-making. Corporate supplier diversity programs—which the Billion Dollar Roundtable tracks among the largest US corporations—channel procurement spending toward minority-, women-, and veteran-owned businesses. These programs are not concessions; they expand supplier pools, drive innovation through diverse perspectives, and build economic capacity in underserved communities.

Equity involves addressing structural barriers that prevent equal outcomes even when access exists. Pay equity audits, anti-discrimination enforcement, progressive taxation, and wealth-building programs (employee stock ownership plans, community land trusts, baby bonds) target the root causes of exclusion rather than symptoms. Salesforce's multi-year pay equity review, which resulted in $22 million in salary adjustments, exemplifies corporate action on structural equity.

Resilience ensures that economic gains are durable. This includes social safety nets, portable benefits for gig workers, disaster preparedness for vulnerable communities, and just transition planning for workers and regions affected by industrial shifts. The European Green Deal's Just Transition Mechanism, which mobilizes €55 billion to support communities dependent on fossil fuel industries, represents the most ambitious government-led initiative to integrate inclusion into economic transformation.

## Council Fire's Approach

Council Fire's work in climate resilience and ocean conservation is fundamentally about inclusive economic outcomes. Coastal communities, small island developing states, and marine-dependent livelihoods are among the most vulnerable to climate disruption and economic exclusion simultaneously. We help clients design strategies that build economic resilience and opportunity for these communities—recognizing that conservation and adaptation efforts that ignore inclusion will neither endure nor deserve to.

## Frequently Asked Questions

### How do companies measure their contribution to an inclusive economy?

Start with internal metrics: workforce diversity at all levels, pay equity ratios, benefits accessibility, and promotion rates disaggregated by demographic group. Then extend to external impact: supplier diversity spending, community investment levels, product accessibility (pricing and distribution reach), and tax contribution to local economies. The Inclusive Development Index developed by the World Economic Forum provides a macro-level benchmark, while the JUST Capital rankings offer company-level comparisons on workforce treatment and community impact. The challenge is moving beyond reporting to action—using measurement to identify gaps and allocate resources toward closing them.

### What is the relationship between inclusive economy and ESG performance?

Strong correlation, increasingly supported by data. Companies ranked highly on inclusivity metrics tend to outperform on ESG assessments because inclusion touches all three pillars: social (workforce treatment, community impact), environmental (equitable distribution of environmental benefits and burdens), and governance (board diversity, stakeholder representation). MSCI research shows that companies in the top quartile for social factor performance deliver lower cost of capital and higher operating margins than bottom-quartile peers. Inclusion is not a separate agenda from ESG—it is the connective tissue.

### Can economic growth and inclusion be pursued simultaneously?

The evidence strongly suggests yes, and that pursuing them separately undermines both. Growth without inclusion produces instability, populist backlash, and demand destruction as consumer purchasing power concentrates. Inclusion without growth becomes a zero-sum redistribution exercise that lacks political sustainability. The countries that have sustained the highest levels of well-being over decades—the Nordic nations, but also outliers like Costa Rica and Botswana—have combined growth-oriented economic policies with robust inclusion mechanisms. The question is not whether growth and inclusion are compatible but whether the political will exists to pursue them together.
