## What is a Deforestation-Free Supply Chain?

A deforestation-free supply chain is one in which raw materials and commodities are produced, sourced, and traded without contributing to the destruction or degradation of forests. This applies to both legal and illegal deforestation, recognizing that legality alone does not guarantee ecological integrity. The concept encompasses direct conversion of forestland for commodity production as well as indirect land-use change driven by market demand.

## Why It Matters

Commodity-driven deforestation accounts for approximately 70% of tropical forest loss globally. Between 2001 and 2020, the world lost roughly 411 million hectares of tree cover — an area larger than the European Union. Six commodities drive the majority of this destruction: palm oil, soy, cattle, cocoa, coffee, and rubber. These supply chains connect smallholder farms in tropical nations to consumer products sold in every major economy.

The financial sector has begun pricing deforestation risk. Investors managing over $8.7 trillion in assets have signed the Financial Sector Deforestation Action initiative, signaling that companies unable to demonstrate deforestation-free sourcing face capital allocation consequences. Insurance underwriters are following suit, recognizing that deforestation amplifies climate risk, supply chain disruption, and reputational exposure.

Regulatory frameworks are hardening. The EU Deforestation Regulation (EUDR), adopted in 2023, requires companies placing specified commodities on the EU market to demonstrate that products are deforestation-free and legally produced. Similar legislation is advancing in the UK, and the US has explored comparable measures through the FOREST Act proposals. Companies that delay supply chain transformation face market access barriers.

Beyond compliance, deforestation-free supply chains protect the carbon sinks, watershed functions, and biodiversity that underpin agricultural productivity itself. Tropical forests regulate regional rainfall patterns — their loss can trigger agricultural yield declines hundreds of kilometers away. Supply chain deforestation is, in many cases, self-defeating for the industries that drive it.

## How It Works / Key Components

Achieving deforestation-free sourcing requires traceability, due diligence, and verification across multi-tier supply chains. Traceability means knowing the geographic origin of commodities to the plot or farm level. This demands investment in GPS-based mapping, supply chain management platforms, and direct relationships with producers — a significant departure from the anonymous commodity trading that has historically dominated agricultural markets.

Due diligence systems assess deforestation risk at the sourcing origin. Companies must establish cutoff dates — the EUDR uses December 31, 2020 — and verify that production areas have not been converted from forest after that date. This requires satellite monitoring (tools like Global Forest Watch provide free, near-real-time deforestation alerts), combined with ground-truthing and supplier engagement to validate remote sensing data.

Certification schemes such as the Roundtable on Sustainable Palm Oil (RSPO), Rainforest Alliance, and ProTerra Foundation provide third-party verification frameworks. However, certification alone has proven insufficient — coverage gaps, audit limitations, and the exclusion of smallholders from certification programs mean that company-level due diligence must go beyond reliance on labels.

Smallholder inclusion is the critical equity dimension. Roughly 80% of tropical deforestation-risk commodities are produced by smallholders farming under five hectares. Due diligence requirements that impose traceability costs without providing technical support or market incentives risk excluding the most vulnerable producers. Effective deforestation-free supply chain programs invest in landscape-level approaches, farmer training, and alternative livelihood support alongside compliance mechanisms.

## Council Fire's Approach

Council Fire advises companies on designing and implementing deforestation-free supply chain strategies that meet regulatory requirements while maintaining commercial viability. Our work spans EUDR compliance readiness, traceability system architecture, supplier engagement programs, and landscape-level partnership development — drawing on deep expertise in climate resilience and sustainable commodity markets.

## Frequently Asked Questions

### What is the difference between "deforestation-free" and "zero deforestation"?
"Zero deforestation" typically means no forest loss of any kind. "Deforestation-free" often uses a cutoff date — commodities are considered compliant if sourced from land not deforested after a specified date. The EUDR, for instance, uses a December 31, 2020 cutoff. This distinction matters for compliance planning and supplier assessment.

### Which commodities are covered by deforestation-free regulations?
The EUDR covers cattle, cocoa, coffee, oil palm, rubber, soya, and wood, plus derived products like leather, chocolate, and furniture. Other legislative proposals vary in commodity scope. Companies should assess their full product portfolio for embedded deforestation risk, not just primary commodities.

### How do companies verify deforestation-free claims?
Verification combines satellite monitoring, geolocation data from producers, third-party audits, and increasingly, blockchain-based traceability platforms. No single tool is sufficient. Robust systems layer multiple data sources and maintain chain-of-custody documentation from origin to market.
