## What is Impact Materiality?

Impact materiality evaluates the significance of an organization's actual or potential effects on people, communities, and the environment. Under the EU's European Sustainability Reporting Standards (ESRS), a topic is impact-material when the company's activities or business relationships cause or contribute to positive or negative impacts that are significant based on their severity (scale, scope, and irremediable character) or likelihood. It represents the "inside-out" lens of double materiality.

## Why It Matters

Impact materiality marks a fundamental shift in corporate reporting philosophy. Traditional financial reporting asks: "What affects our bottom line?" Impact materiality asks: "What does our business do to the world?" This distinction matters because many of the most consequential corporate impacts—polluted waterways, exploitative labor conditions, biodiversity loss—may not register on a company's income statement for years, if ever, yet remain profoundly material to affected communities and ecosystems.

The CSRD has made impact materiality legally binding for roughly 50,000 companies reporting under ESRS. Unlike the ISSB's financial materiality focus, ESRS requires companies to disclose on topics where their impacts are significant regardless of whether those impacts create financial risk. This means a company with negligible financial exposure to water scarcity might still need to report extensively if its operations significantly deplete water resources in stressed regions.

For practitioners, impact materiality introduces analytical complexity that financial materiality doesn't. Assessing outward impacts requires understanding causal chains between business activities and real-world outcomes, often across multiple tiers of a value chain. A fashion brand's impact on labor rights extends through cut-make-trim suppliers, fabric mills, fiber producers, and raw material extraction—each with distinct impact profiles and varying degrees of company influence.

The enforcement dimension is emerging rapidly. The EU's anti-greenwashing agenda means that impact claims must be substantiated. Companies that disclose minimal outward impacts while operating in high-impact sectors will face scrutiny from assurance providers, regulators, and civil society watchdogs. Understating impact materiality carries its own form of legal and reputational risk.

## How It Works / Key Components

**Impact identification** begins with mapping the organization's activities, products, services, and business relationships across the value chain. For each activity, the assessment identifies actual impacts (those already occurring) and potential impacts (those that could reasonably occur). Sources include operational data, supplier assessments, incident records, media analysis, stakeholder input, and sector-specific research from organizations like the OECD, ILO, or UNEP.

**Severity assessment** is the primary criterion for evaluating negative impacts. ESRS defines severity along three dimensions: scale (how grave the impact is), scope (how widespread it is), and irremediable character (how difficult it is to restore those affected to their prior condition). A chemical spill affecting a small area but rendering groundwater permanently unusable scores high on irremediability even if the geographic scope is limited. For potential impacts, likelihood is factored in alongside severity.

**Threshold determination** establishes when an impact crosses from notable to material. ESRS does not prescribe quantitative thresholds—companies must apply judgment and document their reasoning. Best practice involves establishing a scoring methodology (e.g., a 1–5 scale for each severity dimension), applying it consistently across all identified impacts, and setting a threshold above which topics are deemed material. The methodology, scores, and rationale must be audit-ready.

**Positive impacts** also factor into the assessment, though ESRS emphasizes that positive impacts cannot offset or cancel out negative ones. A mining company's community development programs don't negate its environmental damage. Positive impacts are assessed separately and may trigger disclosure requirements of their own, particularly around the effectiveness and scale of sustainability-related initiatives.

## Council Fire's Approach

Council Fire guides organizations through impact materiality assessments that satisfy ESRS requirements while producing genuinely useful strategic insights. We combine value chain mapping, sector benchmarking, and structured stakeholder input to identify and score impacts with the rigor assurance providers expect, then translate results into actionable reporting plans and impact management strategies.

## Frequently Asked Questions

### How does impact materiality differ from ESG impact measurement?
Impact materiality is a threshold test—it determines whether a topic is significant enough to warrant reporting. Impact measurement quantifies the magnitude of specific outcomes (e.g., tonnes of CO₂ avoided, number of people lifted above the living wage). You need materiality assessment first to determine which impacts to measure, and measurement data can inform future materiality assessments. They're complementary but distinct exercises.

### Can a topic be impact-material but not financially material?
Yes, and this is precisely the scenario that double materiality was designed to capture. A company's operations might significantly pollute a river (high impact materiality) without facing any financial consequences—perhaps because regulations are weak, the company holds the necessary permits, or affected communities lack legal recourse. Under ESRS, the company must still report on this impact. Under a purely financial materiality framework (like ISSB), it might not.

### How do you assess impacts in the value chain when data is limited?
This is the most common practical challenge. ESRS acknowledges data limitations and allows the use of sector-average data, proxies, and estimates where company-specific data isn't available. The key is transparency: disclose what data sources you used, where you relied on estimates, and what steps you're taking to improve data quality over time. Prioritize direct data collection for the highest-severity impacts and use industry benchmarks for lower-risk areas.
