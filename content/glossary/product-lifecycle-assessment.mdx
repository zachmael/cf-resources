## What is Product Lifecycle Assessment?

Product lifecycle assessment (LCA) is a standardized methodology for quantifying the environmental impacts of a product, process, or service across its entire life—from raw material extraction through manufacturing, distribution, use, and end-of-life management. Governed by ISO 14040 and ISO 14044, LCA evaluates multiple impact categories including climate change, resource depletion, water use, acidification, and ecotoxicity, providing a comprehensive picture rather than a single-metric snapshot.

## Why It Matters

LCA prevents burden-shifting—the unintended consequence of solving one environmental problem by creating another. A company that switches from plastic to paper packaging may reduce ocean pollution but increase carbon emissions, water consumption, and deforestation. Without lifecycle thinking, well-intentioned decisions can produce net-negative environmental outcomes. LCA provides the analytical rigor to evaluate trade-offs and identify genuinely better alternatives.

Regulatory requirements are increasingly mandating or referencing LCA. The EU's Product Environmental Footprint (PEF) methodology, derived from LCA principles, will underpin environmental claims substantiation under the Green Claims Directive. France's Climate and Resilience Law requires environmental labeling based on LCA for certain product categories. The ISSB's product-level emissions disclosure expectations also draw on LCA thinking.

Corporate applications extend well beyond compliance. Leading companies use LCA to identify hotspots in their value chains, prioritize emissions reduction investments, evaluate material substitutions, substantiate marketing claims, and inform product development. Unilever, for instance, has conducted LCAs across its portfolio to identify that consumer use (hot water for washing) dominates the lifecycle impact of many products—directing innovation toward cold-water-effective formulations.

The growing availability of LCA databases and software has democratized access. Tools like SimaPro, GaBi, openLCA, and cloud-based platforms like Ecochain and Sphera make LCA feasible for organizations without dedicated environmental engineering teams, though interpretation still requires expertise.

## How It Works / Key Components

LCA follows four phases defined by ISO 14040. Goal and scope definition establishes the purpose, system boundaries, functional unit (the reference for comparison—e.g., "delivering 1 liter of beverage to a consumer"), and impact categories to evaluate. Clear scope definition prevents the analysis from becoming unwieldy and ensures comparability.

Life cycle inventory (LCI) analysis quantifies all relevant inputs (raw materials, energy, water) and outputs (emissions, waste, co-products) at each lifecycle stage. This data-intensive phase draws on primary data from the supply chain and secondary data from databases like ecoinvent, GaBi, and ELCD. Data quality directly determines results quality—supplier-specific primary data outperforms generic industry averages.

Life cycle impact assessment (LCIA) translates inventory data into environmental impact scores using characterization models. For climate change, CO₂, methane, and N₂O emissions are converted to CO₂ equivalents using global warming potentials. Similar models exist for acidification (SO₂ equivalents), eutrophication (PO₄ equivalents), and other categories. Methods like ReCiPe and TRACI provide harmonized characterization factors.

Interpretation synthesizes findings, identifies significant issues, evaluates data quality and sensitivity, and draws conclusions. Sensitivity analysis tests how results change with different assumptions—a critical step given the inherent uncertainties in LCA. Peer review by an independent expert panel is required for comparative assertions disclosed to the public.

## Council Fire's Approach

Council Fire conducts product lifecycle assessments that balance analytical rigor with strategic utility. We help clients identify high-impact intervention points, evaluate design alternatives quantitatively, and translate LCA findings into actionable product development and supply chain strategies that reduce environmental footprint while maintaining commercial performance.

## Frequently Asked Questions

### How long does an LCA take to complete?
A screening-level LCA using secondary data can be completed in 4-8 weeks. A full LCA with primary supplier data, multiple impact categories, and peer review typically takes 3-6 months. Comparative LCAs for public disclosure require the most rigor and time.

### What is the difference between cradle-to-gate and cradle-to-grave LCA?
Cradle-to-gate covers impacts from raw material extraction through manufacturing (the factory gate). Cradle-to-grave extends through use and end-of-life. Cradle-to-cradle goes further by designing for perpetual material cycling. The appropriate boundary depends on the study's purpose and the significance of downstream impacts.

### Can LCA compare fundamentally different products?
Yes, provided they deliver the same functional unit. Comparing a glass bottle to a plastic pouch requires defining equivalent functionality—e.g., "containing and preserving 500ml of juice through a 12-month shelf life." The functional unit ensures comparison is based on equivalent service delivery, not arbitrary product matching.
