## What is Double Materiality?

Double materiality is a reporting principle that requires organizations to evaluate sustainability from two directions simultaneously. The first direction — financial materiality — asks how environmental and social issues affect the company's financial performance. The second — impact materiality — asks how the company's operations affect people and the planet.

The concept originated in EU regulatory thinking and became legally binding through the Corporate Sustainability Reporting Directive (CSRD), which requires roughly 50,000 companies to conduct double materiality assessments starting in 2025-2026.

Most US-based sustainability frameworks, including those from the SEC and ISSB, focus primarily on financial materiality — what affects the investor. Double materiality adds the outside-in perspective: what affects everyone else.

## Why It Matters

Before double materiality, companies could report only on sustainability issues that threatened their bottom line. A chemical manufacturer might disclose water scarcity risk (it affects production costs) but ignore downstream water pollution (it affects communities, not quarterly earnings).

Double materiality closes that gap. Under CSRD, that same manufacturer must assess and disclose both dimensions. This changes how companies prioritize sustainability issues, allocate resources, and engage stakeholders.

For companies with EU operations or supply chains touching the EU, this is not optional. CSRD applies to:

- All large EU companies (250+ employees or €40M+ revenue)
- EU-listed SMEs (with simplified standards)
- Non-EU companies with €150M+ EU revenue (starting 2028)

The practical impact is significant. Double materiality assessments typically identify 2-3x more material topics than financial-only approaches. Issues like biodiversity loss, community displacement, or labor conditions in supply chains — previously considered "non-financial" — become reportable obligations.

## How Double Materiality Assessments Work

A double materiality assessment follows a structured process:

**1. Identify potentially material topics.** Start with the full list of ESRS (European Sustainability Reporting Standards) topics: climate change, pollution, water, biodiversity, workers, affected communities, consumers, and business conduct.

**2. Assess financial materiality.** For each topic, evaluate whether it creates material financial risks or opportunities for the organization. This includes physical risks (floods damaging facilities), transition risks (carbon pricing increasing costs), and opportunities (new markets for sustainable products).

**3. Assess impact materiality.** For each topic, evaluate the severity and likelihood of the company's actual or potential impacts on people and the environment. Severity considers scale (how widespread), scope (how many affected), and irremediability (can the damage be undone).

**4. Engage stakeholders.** Double materiality requires genuine input from affected stakeholders — not just investors, but employees, communities, suppliers, and civil society. Their perspectives inform impact materiality assessments.

**5. Set materiality thresholds.** A topic is material if it meets the threshold on either dimension. You do not need to be material on both — either financial or impact materiality alone triggers disclosure requirements.

**6. Document methodology.** Auditors will review your process. The methodology must be transparent, repeatable, and defensible.

## The Cost Problem

Traditional double materiality assessments run $200,000 to $500,000 when conducted by major consulting firms. They produce static PDF reports that become outdated within months as regulations evolve, stakeholder expectations shift, and new risks emerge.

This creates a particular challenge for mid-market companies. The Big 4 consulting firms are overwhelmed with demand from large enterprises, leaving mid-sized companies with limited options. Many are turning to technology-enabled approaches that combine structured methodology with continuous monitoring.

## Common Mistakes

**Treating it as a checkbox exercise.** Companies that rush through double materiality to meet compliance deadlines often miss material topics entirely. The process requires genuine analysis, not template-filling.

**Ignoring impact materiality.** Organizations accustomed to financial-only materiality often under-resource the impact side. But under CSRD, impact materiality triggers just as many disclosure requirements.

**Skipping stakeholder engagement.** Some companies conduct "desk-based" assessments without consulting affected communities or workers. Auditors are increasingly scrutinizing whether stakeholder input was real or performative.

**Treating it as one-and-done.** Materiality is dynamic. A topic that was immaterial in 2025 may become material by 2027. Companies need monitoring systems, not static reports.

## Council Fire's Approach

Council Fire has spent over 20 years helping organizations assess their environmental and social impacts through a systems-thinking lens. Our team of strategists, scientists, economists, and lawyers brings the interdisciplinary perspective that double materiality demands — understanding both the financial risk language boards need and the impact assessment rigor that stakeholders expect.

We work with companies, foundations, and government agencies to design materiality processes that are defensible, actionable, and built to evolve.

## Frequently Asked Questions

### How is double materiality different from single materiality?
Single materiality (used by ISSB, SEC) only considers how sustainability issues affect the company financially. Double materiality adds a second lens: how the company affects people and the environment. Under double materiality, a topic is reportable if it meets either threshold.

### Does double materiality apply to US companies?
Directly, only if they have significant EU revenue (€150M+ triggers CSRD for non-EU companies starting 2028). Indirectly, many US companies are conducting double materiality assessments voluntarily because investors, customers, and regulators are converging on this standard globally.

### How long does a double materiality assessment take?
A thorough assessment typically takes 3-6 months, including stakeholder engagement, data collection, and methodology documentation. Rushed assessments (under 2 months) often produce results that don't survive auditor scrutiny.

### Can technology replace the consulting process?
Technology can automate data collection, stakeholder surveys, and monitoring — but the methodology design, stakeholder facilitation, and judgment calls still require expert guidance. The best approach combines technology platforms with advisory support.
