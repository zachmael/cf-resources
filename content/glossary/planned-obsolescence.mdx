## What is Planned Obsolescence?

Planned obsolescence is the intentional design of products with artificially limited useful lifespans, compelling consumers to purchase replacements more frequently than functional necessity would require. It takes multiple forms: technical obsolescence (components engineered to fail after a predetermined period), systemic obsolescence (software updates that degrade performance on older hardware), aesthetic obsolescence (style changes that render functional products unfashionable), and notification obsolescence (alerts or warnings that pressure replacement of functional products). The concept was formalized in the 1950s but has roots in the 1920s Phoebus cartel, which coordinated lightbulb manufacturers to limit bulb lifespans to 1,000 hours.

## Why It Matters

Planned obsolescence is a primary driver of the global waste crisis. The average smartphone is replaced every 2.5 years despite hardware lifespans of 5–7 years. Printer manufacturers design cartridges with chips that report empty while ink remains. Fast fashion retailers release 52 micro-seasons per year, training consumers to treat clothing as disposable. These patterns generate enormous volumes of waste—the world produces over 62 million tonnes of e-waste annually, growing at 2.6 million tonnes per year.

The environmental cost extends far beyond waste volume. Manufacturing a single smartphone requires approximately 70 kg of raw materials, including rare earth elements mined under significant environmental impact. When product replacement cycles are artificially shortened, the embedded energy, water, carbon, and material impacts of manufacturing multiply proportionally. The Ellen MacArthur Foundation estimates that extending the useful life of products by 50% could reduce material consumption by 25–30%.

Regulatory action is gaining momentum. France became the first country to criminalize planned obsolescence in 2015, with penalties of up to two years' imprisonment and €300,000 in fines. Italy fined Apple €10 million and Samsung €5 million in 2018 for software updates that deliberately slowed older devices. The EU's Ecodesign for Sustainable Products Regulation addresses planned obsolescence through durability requirements, repairability standards, and software update obligations that prohibit performance degradation.

Consumer trust is at stake. Surveys consistently show that consumers resent perceived obsolescence, and brands caught practicing it face significant backlash. Apple's "Batterygate" scandal—in which the company admitted to throttling iPhone performance via software updates—resulted in a $500 million class-action settlement and lasting reputational damage despite the company's claim that the throttling was intended to preserve battery health.

## How It Works / Key Components

Technical obsolescence operates through material and component choices. Capacitors rated for 2,000 hours instead of 10,000, non-replaceable batteries that degrade after 500 charge cycles, plastic gears in appliances where metal would last decades—these are design decisions, not engineering constraints. Cost optimization drives some of these choices legitimately, but the line between cost engineering and deliberate lifespan limitation is often unclear.

Systemic obsolescence leverages the software-hardware relationship. Operating system updates that require more processing power than older devices can provide, discontinued security patches that render devices vulnerable, and app compatibility requirements that exclude older hardware all create functional obsolescence without any hardware failure. This form is particularly effective because it can be deployed retroactively to installed products.

Aesthetic and psychological obsolescence rely on marketing and social dynamics. Annual model releases with cosmetic changes, trend cycles that stigmatize older products, and status signaling through newness all drive replacement of functional goods. The fashion industry is the most extreme practitioner, but consumer electronics, automotive, and home furnishing industries employ similar strategies.

Countering planned obsolescence requires intervention at multiple levels: product regulation (minimum durability standards, repairability requirements), consumer protection (transparency in product lifespan, warranty enforcement), market development (repair infrastructure, secondary markets, refurbishment operations), and business model innovation (leasing, product-as-a-service, performance-based contracts that incentivize longevity).

## Council Fire's Approach

Council Fire helps organizations transition from planned obsolescence models toward circular and durability-oriented product strategies, connecting product lifespan extension to measurable climate, waste reduction, and ocean pollution prevention outcomes. We advise on regulatory compliance with emerging durability and repairability standards while identifying the business case for product longevity in an era of rising material costs and consumer demand for sustainability.

## Frequently Asked Questions

### Is planned obsolescence illegal?

It depends on jurisdiction and form. France explicitly criminalizes planned obsolescence. The EU's Ecodesign Regulation and proposed Green Claims Directive address it through durability and repairability requirements. In most other jurisdictions, planned obsolescence is not specifically illegal but may violate consumer protection laws if it involves deceptive practices (such as undisclosed software throttling). The regulatory trend is clearly toward greater restriction.

### How can consumers identify planned obsolescence?

Warning signs include non-replaceable batteries, proprietary fasteners that prevent disassembly, unavailability of spare parts, software updates that degrade performance, and products priced below the cost of repair. France's repairability index provides a standardized score at point of sale. Third-party organizations like iFixit publish teardown analyses and repairability scores for major electronics, helping consumers make informed choices.

### What are the alternatives to planned obsolescence as a business model?

Product-as-a-service models (leasing rather than selling), performance-based contracts (paying for outcomes rather than units), modular design (upgradeable components), and premium durability positioning (brands like Miele, Patagonia, and Fairphone that compete on longevity) all offer commercially viable alternatives. These models align manufacturer incentives with product durability, creating value from extended use rather than replacement cycles.
