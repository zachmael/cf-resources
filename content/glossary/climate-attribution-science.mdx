## What is Climate Attribution Science?

Climate attribution science is a field of climate research that uses statistical methods and climate models to determine the degree to which human-caused climate change influenced a specific weather event or long-term trend. There are two main branches: event attribution, which assesses whether climate change made a particular heat wave, flood, or hurricane more likely or intense; and trend attribution, which links observed changes in temperature, precipitation patterns, or sea level to anthropogenic forcing. The field has matured rapidly since its origins in a landmark 2004 study on the 2003 European heat wave.

## Why It Matters

Attribution science has transformed climate change from an abstract future risk into a legally and financially quantifiable present-day factor. When the World Weather Attribution initiative can determine within days that a heat wave was made 150 times more likely by climate change—as they did for the 2021 Pacific Northwest heat dome—it creates a direct evidentiary link between emissions, impacts, and accountability.

This has profound legal implications. Climate litigation cases worldwide exceeded 2,500 by 2024, and attribution science is increasingly central to legal arguments. In landmark cases like Milieudefensie v. Shell and Held v. Montana, attribution evidence helped establish causation between specific emitters or government inaction and measurable climate harms. The Saúl Luciano Lliuya v. RWE case in Germany used attribution science to argue that a specific emitter bears proportional responsibility for glacial melt threatening a Peruvian city.

For financial markets, attribution science sharpens physical risk pricing. When an insurer can attribute a specific percentage of hurricane damages to climate change, it changes loss modeling, premium setting, and capital reserve calculations. Swiss Re estimated that climate change added $13 billion to U.S. insured losses from natural catastrophes in 2020 alone. This attribution-adjusted loss data is reshaping how reinsurers price catastrophe risk globally.

Corporate climate disclosure frameworks are moving toward attribution-informed risk assessment. The TCFD, ISSB, and SEC climate rule all require forward-looking physical risk analysis that implicitly depends on understanding how climate change alters hazard probabilities. Companies that can articulate—using attribution science—how their physical risk profile has already changed and will continue to change demonstrate more sophisticated risk governance and face less scrutiny from investors and regulators.

## How It Works / Key Components

Event attribution studies compare two parallel worlds: the actual world with its accumulated greenhouse gas concentrations, and a counterfactual world without anthropogenic emissions. Using ensembles of climate model simulations, researchers estimate the probability and intensity of a specific event in both worlds. The ratio—expressed as a "fraction of attributable risk" or a probability multiplier—quantifies climate change's contribution.

The methodology has become remarkably fast and robust. The World Weather Attribution initiative, led by researchers at Imperial College London and the Royal Netherlands Meteorological Institute, now publishes peer-quality rapid attribution analyses within days of major events. Their 2023 analysis of the Libya floods determined that climate change made the extreme rainfall up to 50 times more likely and 50% more intense. For the 2023 Canadian wildfire season, they found climate change roughly doubled the likelihood of the fire weather conditions.

Trend attribution operates on longer timescales, linking observed multi-decadal changes to forcing agents. The IPCC's Sixth Assessment Report stated with "unequivocal" confidence that human influence has warmed the atmosphere, ocean, and land—a conclusion built on decades of trend attribution research comparing observed warming patterns against natural variability and anthropogenic forcing signals. These "fingerprinting" studies match the spatial and temporal patterns of observed change to the unique signatures of greenhouse gas forcing, solar variability, volcanic eruptions, and aerosols.

Emerging frontiers include impact attribution (linking climate change to specific economic damages, health outcomes, or ecosystem changes) and source attribution (connecting specific emitters' historical emissions to measurable climate impacts). The Carbon Majors dataset, which traces 71% of global industrial emissions to just 100 companies, provides the emissions data that feeds source attribution analyses. These developments are narrowing the chain of causation from "climate change causes harm" to "this company's emissions contributed to this much harm."

## Council Fire's Approach

Council Fire incorporates attribution science into physical risk assessments, helping clients understand not just what climate hazards they face, but how those hazards have already shifted and will continue shifting due to anthropogenic warming. We translate attribution findings into actionable risk management—informing insurance strategies, capital allocation, legal exposure assessments, and climate disclosure narratives that meet the evidentiary standards increasingly expected by regulators and investors.

## Frequently Asked Questions

### Can attribution science be used in court?

Yes, and it increasingly is. Attribution evidence has been admitted or cited in cases across multiple jurisdictions, including Germany, the Netherlands, the U.K., Australia, and the U.S. The strength of the evidence varies—event attribution provides probabilistic rather than deterministic causation, which aligns better with some legal frameworks than others. Tort law's "balance of probabilities" standard in many jurisdictions is well-suited to attribution evidence. The trend is clearly toward greater legal relevance, and companies with significant emissions histories should factor litigation risk informed by attribution science into their legal and financial planning.

### How accurate is climate attribution science?

Attribution studies carry explicit uncertainty ranges, and their reliability depends on the type of event. Heat events are the most confidently attributed—the climate signal is strong and well-modeled. Precipitation extremes and flooding are moderately attributable, with wider uncertainty ranges. Tropical cyclone attribution is improving but remains challenging due to limited historical data and modeling complexity. The IPCC assigns confidence levels to attribution findings, and the field's track record of subsequent verification (initial rapid studies confirmed by later peer-reviewed analyses) supports its reliability.

### What does attribution science mean for corporate liability?

Attribution science creates a quantifiable link between emissions and impacts that could inform liability in several ways: duty-of-care arguments against high-emitting companies, shareholder claims against boards that failed to manage disclosed climate risks, and government cost-recovery actions seeking reimbursement for climate adaptation expenditures. The Carbon Majors framework enables attribution to specific entities. While no company has yet paid damages based solely on attribution science, the legal trajectory suggests this is a matter of when, not if—particularly as attribution methodologies achieve broader scientific consensus and judicial acceptance.
