## What is Single Materiality?

Single materiality is a reporting approach that evaluates sustainability topics exclusively through the lens of their financial impact on the reporting entity—how environmental, social, and governance factors affect the company's cash flows, financial position, and enterprise value. Under this framework, a sustainability issue is material only if it could reasonably influence investor decision-making. This contrasts with double materiality, which also considers the company's impact on people and the environment regardless of financial consequences. The ISSB standards (IFRS S1 and S2) and the SEC climate disclosure rule adopt a single materiality (or "financial materiality") approach.

## Why It Matters

The materiality lens a company uses determines what it reports, how much it reports, and who it reports for. Single materiality narrows the aperture to investor-relevant information, which proponents argue produces more focused, decision-useful disclosures. A chemical company under single materiality would report on water pollution only if the associated regulatory, litigation, or reputational risks could materially affect financial performance—not because water pollution harms downstream communities per se.

This distinction has enormous practical implications. Under the CSRD's double materiality standard, a European apparel company might need to disclose detailed information about living wages in its supply chain because the impact on garment workers is significant, even if the financial risk to the company is modest. Under ISSB single materiality, that same topic might not meet the disclosure threshold unless it creates quantifiable financial exposure through regulation, consumer boycotts, or supply disruption.

The debate between single and double materiality is the central fault line in global sustainability reporting. The U.S., UK, and most Asia-Pacific jurisdictions are adopting ISSB's single materiality approach. The EU mandates double materiality through the CSRD. Companies operating across both regimes must navigate a reporting scope that differs fundamentally depending on jurisdiction. This creates compliance complexity but also strategic choice—companies can choose to adopt the broader double materiality standard globally for consistency, or maintain jurisdiction-specific reporting scopes.

Critics of single materiality argue it creates dangerous blind spots. Climate systemic risk, biodiversity collapse, and social inequality may not register as material to individual companies in the short term while posing existential risks to the economic system those companies operate within. The "tragedy of the horizons"—Mark Carney's phrase for the mismatch between financial time horizons and climate impact timescales—is fundamentally a materiality problem. Issues that aren't financially material today may become catastrophically material tomorrow.

## How It Works / Key Components

Single materiality assessment follows the financial reporting concept of materiality established in accounting standards—information is material if omitting or misstating it could influence the economic decisions of primary users (investors, lenders, creditors). The ISSB's IFRS S1 explicitly connects its materiality definition to the existing IFRS accounting materiality concept, creating consistency between financial and sustainability reporting.

In practice, companies conduct single materiality assessments by: identifying sustainability topics relevant to their industry (using SASB industry standards as a starting point), evaluating each topic's potential to affect financial performance through revenues, costs, assets, liabilities, capital allocation, or financing, assessing likelihood and magnitude over short, medium, and long time horizons, and determining whether the resulting information would influence reasonable investor decisions. Topics that pass this threshold require disclosure; those that don't may be excluded.

The time horizon question is particularly contentious. Single materiality in accounting has traditionally focused on near-term financial statement periods. Sustainability risks—particularly climate change and biodiversity loss—operate on multi-decadal timescales. ISSB addresses this by requiring consideration of short, medium, and long-term horizons, but the practical interpretation of "long-term" varies. A 30-year climate risk may be material to a real estate company with long-lived assets but arguably immaterial to a technology company with rapid asset turnover.

Interoperability mechanisms attempt to bridge the gap between single and double materiality jurisdictions. The ISSB and GRI developed guidance showing how single materiality disclosures can be supplemented with impact-oriented information for stakeholders beyond investors. Companies in CSRD jurisdictions that also report under ISSB can leverage ESRS-to-ISSB mapping to avoid full duplication. The practical convergence is that most large companies will report under both approaches, with single materiality serving as the minimum baseline.

## Council Fire's Approach

Council Fire guides clients through materiality assessments calibrated to their regulatory obligations, investor expectations, and strategic priorities. Whether a client operates under single materiality (ISSB), double materiality (CSRD), or both, we ensure the assessment process is rigorous, documented, and produces a disclosure scope that satisfies compliance requirements while surfacing the sustainability issues most relevant to long-term value creation and risk management.

## Frequently Asked Questions

### Can a company use single materiality if it's subject to the CSRD?

No. The CSRD mandates double materiality for all companies in its scope. However, a company subject to the CSRD can also prepare ISSB-aligned disclosures for non-EU investors and jurisdictions using single materiality. The EFRAG (European Financial Reporting Advisory Group) has published interoperability guidance mapping ESRS to ISSB standards, which helps companies produce both outputs without fully duplicating their reporting processes. The practical approach is to conduct a double materiality assessment (as required by CSRD) and then derive the ISSB-relevant subset for investor-focused reporting.

### What sustainability topics typically fall outside single materiality but within double materiality?

Topics where the company has significant external impact but limited financial exposure include: biodiversity impacts in low-regulation jurisdictions, community displacement from operations in developing countries, living wage gaps in supply chains without consumer-facing brand risk, water pollution where regulatory enforcement is weak, and cultural heritage impacts. These topics affect people and the environment but may not create near-term financial consequences for the reporting company. Double materiality captures them; single materiality may not.

### Is single materiality sufficient for managing long-term enterprise risk?

This is the core critique. Single materiality works well for risks that are already priced or priceable—carbon costs, regulatory compliance, litigation exposure. It struggles with systemic risks that affect entire markets rather than individual companies, and with emerging risks where the financial transmission mechanism isn't yet clear. A single-materiality-only approach might have dismissed climate risk as immaterial for most companies as recently as 2015. Companies serious about long-term risk management increasingly supplement single materiality reporting with broader environmental and social analysis, even when not required by regulation, to identify emerging risks before they become financially material surprises.
