## What Is SB 253?

Senate Bill 253, the Climate Corporate Data Accountability Act, was signed into law by Governor Gavin Newsom on October 7, 2023. It requires large public and private companies doing business in California to publicly disclose their Scope 1, Scope 2, and Scope 3 greenhouse gas emissions. The California Air Resources Board (CARB) is responsible for developing implementing regulations.

SB 253 is significant because it covers private companies — unlike the SEC rule, which applies only to public registrants — and because it mandates Scope 3 emissions disclosure, which the SEC's final rule dropped. For many companies, SB 253 will be the most demanding U.S. emissions disclosure requirement they face.

In September 2024, Governor Newsom signed SB 219, an amendment bill that pushed back the initial reporting deadlines by two years and gave CARB additional flexibility on implementation. The updated timelines are reflected below.

## Who Does It Apply To?

SB 253 applies to any entity — public or private, U.S. or foreign — that:

- Is a partnership, corporation, LLC, or other business entity, **and**
- Does business in California, **and**
- Has total annual revenues exceeding **$1 billion** (based on the entity's prior fiscal year)

"Doing business in California" is defined under existing California tax law (Revenue and Taxation Code §23101), which includes having sales, property, or payroll in the state. This captures thousands of companies headquartered outside California.

Financial institutions, insurance companies, and entities already reporting under the EPA's Greenhouse Gas Reporting Program (GHGRP) are not exempt. The revenue threshold applies at the entity level, not the consolidated group level, though CARB may provide further guidance.

## Key Requirements

**Scope 1 and Scope 2 Emissions:** Companies must report direct emissions (Scope 1) and purchased electricity/energy emissions (Scope 2) starting in 2026 for reporting year 2025.

**Scope 3 Emissions:** Companies must report indirect value chain emissions (Scope 3) starting in 2027 for reporting year 2026. CARB has discretion to delay the Scope 3 deadline by up to two additional years if needed.

**Reporting Standard:** Emissions must be quantified in conformance with the Greenhouse Gas Protocol Corporate Standard and Corporate Value Chain (Scope 3) Standard, including any updates to those standards.

**Third-Party Assurance:** Scope 1 and 2 disclosures require limited assurance beginning with the first reporting year, moving to reasonable assurance in subsequent years. Scope 3 disclosures require limited assurance starting in 2030.

**Public Disclosure:** Reports are made publicly available on a digital platform maintained by CARB or a designated reporting organization.

**Consolidation:** Emissions shall be reported at the reporting entity level. CARB will develop rules addressing consolidated vs. entity-level reporting for corporate groups.

## Timeline (Post-SB 219 Amendments)

| Requirement | Reporting Year | Reports Due |
|---|---|---|
| Scope 1 & 2 emissions | 2025 | 2026 |
| Scope 3 emissions | 2026 | 2027 |
| Limited assurance (Scope 1 & 2) | 2025 | 2026 |
| Reasonable assurance (Scope 1 & 2) | 2028 | 2029 |
| Limited assurance (Scope 3) | 2030 | 2031 |

## Compliance Steps

1. **Confirm applicability.** Review your California nexus and prior-year revenue against the $1B threshold.
2. **Establish GHG accounting.** If you don't already have a GHG inventory, build one using the GHG Protocol Corporate Standard. Scope 1 and 2 are table stakes; Scope 3 requires a category-by-category assessment.
3. **Identify Scope 3 categories.** The GHG Protocol defines 15 Scope 3 categories. Conduct a screening assessment to prioritize the material ones: purchased goods and services, capital goods, fuel- and energy-related activities, upstream/downstream transportation, business travel, employee commuting, and end-of-life treatment of sold products are common hotspots.
4. **Secure assurance.** Engage an assurance provider early. The provider must be independent and use recognized assurance standards (e.g., ISAE 3000 or ISAE 3410).
5. **Track CARB rulemaking.** CARB is developing detailed implementing regulations. Participate in public comment periods to influence reporting formats, safe harbors, and Scope 3 flexibility.
6. **Coordinate with other mandates.** If you're also subject to the SEC rule, CSRD, or California SB 261, build a unified data platform to avoid duplicative effort.

## Penalties and Enforcement

SB 253 authorizes administrative penalties of up to **$500,000 per reporting year** for non-compliance, with lower penalties for Scope 3 misstatements made with reasonable basis and disclosed methodology. CARB has enforcement authority and may also refer matters to the California Attorney General.

The SB 219 amendments clarified that companies will not face penalties during the first year of reporting if they make good-faith efforts to comply and disclose any data limitations.

## How Sustainability Consultants Help

Consultants build GHG inventories from scratch, conduct Scope 3 screening assessments, implement data collection systems across procurement and supply chain teams, prepare assurance-ready documentation, and represent clients in CARB rulemaking proceedings. For companies facing their first mandatory emissions disclosure, the difference between a well-structured GHG inventory and an ad hoc estimate is the difference between passing assurance and failing it.

## Frequently Asked Questions

**Does SB 253 apply to private companies?**
Yes. Any entity doing business in California with annual revenues over $1 billion is in scope, regardless of whether it is publicly traded.

**Is Scope 3 really mandatory?**
Yes, starting with reporting year 2026 (due 2027). CARB may delay by up to two years, but the statutory requirement stands.

**What happens if my Scope 3 data is incomplete?**
The law recognizes that Scope 3 data quality varies. Companies must use the GHG Protocol's Scope 3 standard and disclose their methodology, data sources, and limitations. Good-faith efforts with transparent methodology reduce penalty risk.

**How does SB 253 interact with the SEC climate rule?**
They are separate mandates with different scopes (SB 253 covers private companies; the SEC rule covers registrants), different emissions requirements (SB 253 includes Scope 3; the SEC rule does not), and different enforcement mechanisms.

**Who counts as "doing business in California"?**
Under Revenue and Taxation Code §23101, you're doing business in California if you have sales, property, or payroll in the state, or if you are organized or commercially domiciled there.
