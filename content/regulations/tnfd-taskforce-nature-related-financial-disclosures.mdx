## What Is the TNFD?

The Taskforce on Nature-related Financial Disclosures (TNFD) released its final recommendations in September 2023. Modeled on the TCFD framework for climate, the TNFD provides a risk management and disclosure framework for organizations to report on nature-related dependencies, impacts, risks, and opportunities.

The TNFD is not itself a regulation — it is a voluntary framework. However, its relevance is growing rapidly because regulators are incorporating nature-related disclosure into mandatory requirements. The EU's CSRD (through ESRS E4 on biodiversity) and the Kunming-Montreal Global Biodiversity Framework both reference nature-related reporting that aligns with TNFD concepts. Several jurisdictions, including France and Brazil, have signaled they will require TNFD-aligned disclosures.

By January 2025, over 500 organizations globally had committed to adopting the TNFD recommendations, including major banks, asset managers, and multinational corporations.

## Who Should Adopt It?

While voluntary, the TNFD is most relevant to:

- **Companies with material nature dependencies or impacts** — agriculture, food and beverage, mining, forestry, real estate, infrastructure, tourism, and pharmaceuticals
- **Financial institutions** — banks, insurers, and asset managers with exposure to nature-dependent sectors
- **Companies subject to the CSRD** — ESRS E4 (Biodiversity and ecosystems) draws on TNFD concepts; early TNFD adoption eases CSRD compliance
- **Companies disclosing through CDP** — CDP integrated TNFD-aligned questions into its 2024 questionnaire

## Key Components

**Four Pillars (mirroring TCFD):**
1. **Governance** — Board and management oversight of nature-related issues
2. **Strategy** — Nature-related dependencies, impacts, risks, and opportunities across the value chain
3. **Risk & Impact Management** — Processes for identifying, assessing, prioritizing, and managing nature-related issues
4. **Metrics & Targets** — Metrics used to assess and manage nature-related issues, including targets and performance

**The LEAP Approach:** TNFD developed a structured assessment process called LEAP:
- **L – Locate** your interface with nature (where are your operations, assets, and value chains in relation to sensitive ecosystems?)
- **E – Evaluate** your dependencies and impacts on nature
- **A – Assess** your nature-related risks and opportunities
- **P – Prepare** to respond and report

LEAP is designed as a practical, iterative process. It draws on tools like the ENCORE database (for dependency mapping), the IBAT tool (for biodiversity data), and the Natural Capital Protocol.

**Core Metrics:** The TNFD recommends a set of core global metrics and core sector metrics. Core global metrics include land/freshwater/ocean use change, extent of land/freshwater/ocean degradation, pollution to soil/water/air, introduction of invasive species, and state of species (e.g., IUCN Red List species affected).

## Timeline

| Milestone | Date |
|-----------|------|
| TNFD beta framework v0.1 | March 2022 |
| Final TNFD recommendations released | September 18, 2023 |
| TNFD adopters register launched | January 2024 |
| CDP integrates TNFD questions | 2024 questionnaire cycle |
| First wave of TNFD-aligned disclosures | FY 2024 / early 2025 |
| TNFD guidance updates planned | Ongoing (annual) |

## Implementation Steps

1. **Conduct the LEAP assessment.** Start with the Locate phase — map your direct operations and key supply chain nodes against biodiversity-sensitive areas using IBAT or similar tools.
2. **Identify material nature dependencies.** Use ENCORE or sector-specific guidance to determine which ecosystem services your operations depend on (e.g., pollination, water filtration, soil fertility).
3. **Assess risks and opportunities.** Translate dependencies and impacts into financial risk terms — supply disruption, regulatory action, reputational exposure, and emerging market opportunities (e.g., nature-based solutions, biodiversity credits).
4. **Select metrics.** Start with TNFD core global metrics. Add sector metrics relevant to your industry. Avoid cherry-picking — disclose the metrics that reflect your actual footprint.
5. **Integrate with existing frameworks.** If you report under CSRD, align TNFD outputs with ESRS E4 requirements. If you report to CDP, use TNFD-aligned responses.
6. **Set targets.** Establish measurable, time-bound targets for nature-related performance (e.g., zero net deforestation by 2025, 30% reduction in freshwater withdrawal by 2030).

## Enforcement Context

As a voluntary framework, the TNFD has no direct penalties. However, mandatory requirements that draw on TNFD concepts do carry enforcement consequences:
- **CSRD/ESRS E4:** Failure to report on biodiversity when material triggers CSRD non-compliance penalties
- **Global Biodiversity Framework Target 15:** Requires large companies and financial institutions to assess and disclose nature-related risks by 2030 — signatories are expected to translate this into national regulation
- **French Article 29 (Energy-Climate Law):** Already requires financial institutions to disclose biodiversity strategies

## How Sustainability Consultants Help

Consultants run LEAP assessments, map biodiversity hotspots across supply chains, select and calculate nature-related metrics, draft TNFD-aligned disclosures, and help companies set credible nature targets. Nature-related data is less mature than climate data, and the analytical tools are newer — expert guidance prevents wasted effort on low-value metrics.

## Frequently Asked Questions

**Is the TNFD mandatory?**
Not directly. It is a voluntary framework. However, mandatory regimes (CSRD, CDP, and potentially national laws implementing the Global Biodiversity Framework) increasingly require nature-related disclosures that the TNFD helps structure.

**How does the TNFD relate to the TCFD?**
The TNFD deliberately mirrors the TCFD's four-pillar structure (governance, strategy, risk management, metrics & targets) so that companies can build on existing climate disclosures. Nature is treated as a parallel and interconnected risk domain.

**What tools does the LEAP approach use?**
ENCORE for nature dependency mapping, IBAT for biodiversity data and protected area proximity, the Natural Capital Protocol for valuation, and sector-specific guidance from the TNFD.

**What sectors are most affected?**
Agriculture, food and beverage, mining, forestry, fisheries, real estate, infrastructure, and tourism have the most direct nature dependencies. Financial institutions with exposure to these sectors are also heavily affected.

**Can we start with just the Locate phase?**
Yes. TNFD explicitly recommends a phased approach. Starting with Locate — mapping where your operations and supply chains intersect with nature — provides immediate value and builds the foundation for deeper assessment.
