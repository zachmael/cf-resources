faqs:
  - question: "Is TNFD mandatory?"
    answer: "TNFD itself is a voluntary framework, but its recommendations are being incorporated into mandatory regulations. CSRD ESRS E4 (Biodiversity) is closely aligned with TNFD. ISSB is considering nature-related disclosure. Several stock exchanges and regulators are encouraging or requiring TNFD-aligned reporting. Over 1,000 organizations have committed to TNFD adoption."
  - question: "How does TNFD relate to TCFD?"
    answer: "TNFD is designed as the nature equivalent of TCFD. It follows the same four-pillar structure (Governance, Strategy, Risk Management, Metrics & Targets) and uses a similar approach. However, TNFD adds nature-specific elements: the LEAP assessment approach, location-specific analysis, and consideration of dependencies on nature as well as impacts."
  - question: "What is the LEAP approach?"
    answer: "LEAP is TNFD's core assessment methodology: Locate your interface with nature (where your operations and value chains interact with ecosystems), Evaluate your dependencies and impacts on nature, Assess your nature-related risks and opportunities, and Prepare to respond and report. It provides a systematic approach to understanding your organization's relationship with nature."

## What Is TNFD?

The Taskforce on Nature-related Financial Disclosures (TNFD) published its final recommendations in September 2023, providing a framework for organizations to assess, manage, and disclose nature-related risks, opportunities, and impacts. Modeled on the TCFD for climate, TNFD addresses the broader crisis of biodiversity loss and ecosystem degradation.

Nature-related risks are financially material. Over half of global GDP ($44 trillion) depends on nature. Biodiversity loss, ecosystem degradation, water scarcity, and deforestation create supply chain disruptions, regulatory risks, reputational risks, and stranded asset risks.

## Who It Applies To

TNFD is voluntary but relevant to:
- **All companies** with significant nature-related dependencies or impacts
- **CSRD-reporting companies** (ESRS E4 aligns with TNFD)
- **Financial institutions** managing portfolios exposed to nature-related risks
- **Companies in nature-dependent sectors**: agriculture, food, forestry, mining, construction, pharmaceuticals, utilities
- **Companies committing to the Global Biodiversity Framework** targets

Over 1,000 organizations have signed up as TNFD early adopters.

## Key Requirements

**Four-pillar disclosure structure:**

1. **Governance**: Board and management oversight of nature-related dependencies, impacts, risks, and opportunities
2. **Strategy**: Nature-related risks and opportunities, their impact on business strategy, and the resilience of the strategy under different scenarios
3. **Risk and impact management**: Processes for identifying, assessing, prioritizing, and managing nature-related risks and impacts
4. **Metrics and targets**: Metrics and targets used to assess and manage nature-related issues

**LEAP approach for assessment:**
- **Locate**: Map where your operations and value chain interface with nature using spatial data
- **Evaluate**: Assess your dependencies on ecosystem services and your impacts on nature
- **Assess**: Determine nature-related risks and opportunities arising from dependencies and impacts
- **Prepare**: Develop response strategies and prepare for reporting

**Additional TNFD-specific elements:**
- Location-specific analysis (nature impacts vary by geography)
- Dependencies AND impacts (not just risks)
- Consideration of all four realms of nature: land, ocean, freshwater, atmosphere

## Recommended Metrics

TNFD recommends core metrics organized by:
- **General**: Governance, strategy, risk management disclosures
- **Sector-specific**: Metrics relevant to specific industries
- **Location-specific**: Spatial metrics for operations in or near biodiversity-sensitive areas

Key metrics include:
- Area of operations in or near KBAs and protected areas
- Extent of land-use change and habitat conversion
- Water withdrawal and consumption in stressed basins
- Pollutant releases to air, water, and soil
- Dependencies on ecosystem services by location

## Timeline

- **September 2023**: Final TNFD recommendations published
- **2024-2025**: Early adopter reporting begins; sector guidance published
- **2025+**: Regulatory integration (CSRD E4, potential ISSB nature standard)
- **2030**: Expected widespread adoption aligned with GBF targets

## Compliance Steps

1. **Conduct LEAP assessment**: Systematically assess your nature interface, dependencies, impacts, and risks
2. **Map priority locations**: Identify operations and supply chain nodes in or near biodiversity-sensitive areas
3. **Assess dependencies and impacts**: Use tools like ENCORE, IBAT, and Biodiversity Risk Filter
4. **Evaluate risks and opportunities**: Translate nature-related dependencies and impacts into financial risks and opportunities
5. **Set targets**: Develop nature-related targets aligned with SBTN and GBF
6. **Report**: Publish TNFD-aligned disclosures through your sustainability report
