faqs:
  - question: "Who must comply with CSRD?"
    answer: "CSRD applies to: (1) EU companies already under NFRD (large public-interest entities, 500+ employees) from FY2024; (2) all large EU companies meeting 2 of 3 criteria (250+ employees, €50M revenue, €25M assets) from FY2025; (3) listed SMEs from FY2026 (opt-out until FY2028); (4) non-EU companies with €150M+ EU revenue from FY2028. Subsidiaries of in-scope groups are included."
  - question: "What are the ESRS standards?"
    answer: "The European Sustainability Reporting Standards (ESRS) are the detailed reporting standards developed by EFRAG under CSRD. They include: ESRS 1 (General Requirements), ESRS 2 (General Disclosures — always mandatory), and 10 topical standards covering Environment (E1-E5), Social (S1-S4), and Governance (G1). Topical standards apply based on double materiality assessment."
  - question: "What are the penalties for non-compliance?"
    answer: "Penalties are set by EU member states during national transposition. Expected penalties include fines, public statements of non-compliance, and potential director liability. Since CSRD reports are part of the management report and subject to audit, non-compliance carries similar consequences to financial reporting failures."

## What Is CSRD?

The Corporate Sustainability Reporting Directive (CSRD) is the EU's comprehensive sustainability disclosure regulation, adopted in November 2022. It replaces the Non-Financial Reporting Directive (NFRD) and dramatically expands the scope, detail, and rigor of required sustainability reporting in Europe.

CSRD brings approximately 50,000 companies into mandatory sustainability reporting scope — up from roughly 11,000 under NFRD. For the first time, sustainability reports must be included in the management report, digitally tagged in XBRL format, and subject to mandatory external assurance.

## Who It Applies To

CSRD uses a phased approach:

| Phase | Companies | Reporting Year | First Report Due |
|-------|-----------|---------------|-----------------|
| Phase 1 | Companies already under NFRD | FY2024 | 2025 |
| Phase 2 | Large companies (2 of 3: 250+ employees, €50M+ revenue, €25M+ assets) | FY2025 | 2026 |
| Phase 3 | Listed SMEs | FY2026 (opt-out to FY2028) | 2027-2029 |
| Phase 4 | Non-EU companies with €150M+ EU revenue | FY2028 | 2029 |

Important: the criteria apply at the individual entity or consolidated group level. A non-EU parent company may be in scope through its EU subsidiaries.

## Key Requirements

**Double materiality assessment**: Companies must assess both impact materiality (their effects on people and environment) and financial materiality (how sustainability topics affect the company financially). A topic is reportable if it meets either threshold.

**ESRS compliance**: Report against the European Sustainability Reporting Standards — detailed, prescriptive standards covering:
- ESRS 2: General disclosures (mandatory for all companies)
- E1-E5: Climate change, pollution, water, biodiversity, circular economy
- S1-S4: Own workforce, value chain workers, communities, consumers
- G1: Business conduct

**Value chain coverage**: ESRS requires disclosure on impacts, risks, and opportunities across the full value chain — upstream suppliers, own operations, and downstream customers.

**Digital tagging**: Reports must be tagged in XBRL format per the ESRS digital taxonomy, enabling machine-readable disclosure.

**External assurance**: Limited assurance is mandatory from the first reporting year, with plans to move to reasonable assurance by approximately 2028.

## Timeline and Deadlines

- **January 2023**: CSRD entered into force
- **July 2023**: First set of ESRS adopted by European Commission
- **FY2024**: Phase 1 companies begin reporting
- **FY2025**: Phase 2 companies begin reporting
- **FY2026**: Phase 3 (listed SMEs) begin — with opt-out until FY2028
- **FY2028**: Phase 4 (non-EU companies) begin
- **~2028**: Transition from limited to reasonable assurance (timeline TBC)

## Compliance Steps

1. **Determine your scope and timeline**: Confirm which entities are in scope and when
2. **Conduct double materiality assessment**: Identify material topics across all ESRS standards
3. **Gap analysis**: Map required ESRS datapoints against current data availability
4. **Build data infrastructure**: Establish systems for collecting, validating, and managing required data
5. **Prepare narrative disclosures**: Develop governance, strategy, and risk management narratives
6. **Engage assurance provider**: Select and engage your assurer early in the process
7. **Draft sustainability statement**: Write the ESRS-compliant sustainability section of the management report
8. **XBRL tagging**: Tag the sustainability statement per ESRS digital taxonomy
9. **Assurance engagement**: Complete the assurance process
10. **Board approval and filing**: Obtain board approval and file with the management report

## Penalties

Penalties are determined by individual EU member states during national transposition. Expected enforcement mechanisms include:
- Financial penalties (fines)
- Public naming of non-compliant companies
- Director liability for management report content
- Securities regulator enforcement for listed companies
- Potential impact on access to EU public procurement
