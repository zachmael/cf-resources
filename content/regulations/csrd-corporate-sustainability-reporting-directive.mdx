## What Is the CSRD?

The Corporate Sustainability Reporting Directive (CSRD) is the European Union's flagship sustainability disclosure law, adopted in November 2022 and effective from January 2023. It replaces and significantly expands the Non-Financial Reporting Directive (NFRD), bringing an estimated 50,000 companies into scope — up from roughly 11,700 under the old regime.

The CSRD requires qualifying companies to report against the European Sustainability Reporting Standards (ESRS), developed by the European Financial Reporting Advisory Group (EFRAG). Reports must be included in the company's management report, digitally tagged in XHTML format using the European Single Electronic Format (ESEF), and subject to third-party assurance — initially at limited assurance level, with reasonable assurance planned later.

The directive introduces **double materiality**: companies must disclose both how sustainability matters affect their financial performance and how their operations affect people and the environment. This is a meaningful departure from the financial-materiality-only approach used by frameworks like the ISSB standards.

## Who Does It Apply To?

The CSRD applies in waves based on company type and size:

- **FY 2024 (reports due 2025):** Large public-interest entities already subject to the NFRD — those with 500+ employees listed on EU-regulated markets.
- **FY 2025 (reports due 2026):** All other large EU companies meeting two of three thresholds: 250+ employees, €50M+ net turnover, €25M+ total assets.
- **FY 2026 (reports due 2027):** Listed SMEs, small and non-complex credit institutions, and captive insurance undertakings (with an opt-out until 2028).
- **FY 2028 (reports due 2029):** Non-EU parent companies with €150M+ EU net turnover and at least one EU subsidiary or branch.

Subsidiaries can be exempt if consolidated into a parent company's CSRD-compliant report, subject to conditions.

## Key Requirements

**European Sustainability Reporting Standards (ESRS):** The first set includes 12 standards — two cross-cutting (ESRS 1 and ESRS 2) and ten topical standards covering environment (climate, pollution, water, biodiversity, resource use/circular economy), social (own workforce, workers in the value chain, affected communities, consumers), and governance. ESRS 2 is mandatory for all in-scope companies. Topical standards apply based on the company's materiality assessment.

**Double Materiality Assessment:** Before reporting, companies must conduct a structured assessment to determine which sustainability topics are material from both an impact perspective and a financial perspective. This assessment drives the scope of disclosure.

**Value Chain Reporting:** Companies must report on upstream and downstream sustainability impacts, with a three-year transition period allowing the use of estimates where direct data from value chain partners is unavailable.

**Digital Tagging:** All CSRD reports must be tagged in iXBRL within the ESEF framework, enabling machine-readability and comparability across the EU.

**Assurance:** Limited assurance is required from day one. The European Commission has indicated it will adopt limited assurance standards by October 2026, with a move to reasonable assurance standards expected by October 2028.

## Timeline and Deadlines

| Milestone | Date |
|-----------|------|
| CSRD entered into force | January 5, 2023 |
| Member state transposition deadline | July 6, 2024 |
| First reports due (large PIEs) | 2025 (for FY 2024) |
| Large EU companies report | 2026 (for FY 2025) |
| Listed SMEs report (or opt out) | 2027 (for FY 2026) |
| Non-EU companies report | 2029 (for FY 2028) |

## Compliance Steps

1. **Determine applicability.** Confirm whether your entity meets the size or listing thresholds, including the non-EU parent company rule.
2. **Run a double materiality assessment.** Engage stakeholders, map your value chain, and identify material topics under both impact and financial materiality lenses.
3. **Gap analysis against ESRS.** Compare current disclosures to the specific data points required by each applicable ESRS standard.
4. **Build data collection infrastructure.** Many ESRS data points (e.g., Scope 3 emissions, workforce diversity metrics, biodiversity impacts) require new data pipelines that cross departmental and supplier boundaries.
5. **Select an assurance provider.** Engage an auditor or independent assurance provider early — the market for CSRD assurance is competitive, and providers need lead time.
6. **Prepare the management report.** Integrate sustainability disclosures into the annual management report, apply iXBRL tagging, and ensure consistency with financial statements.
7. **Conduct a dry run.** Produce a shadow report for the year before your mandatory start date to identify weaknesses.

## Penalties and Enforcement

Enforcement is handled at the member state level. Each EU country must transpose the CSRD and define penalties. In practice, this means fines, public censure, and personal liability for directors who sign off on non-compliant reports. Germany's Financial Reporting Enforcement Panel (DPR/FREP) and France's AMF are among the agencies expected to take an active role. Penalties for non-compliance with the NFRD have historically ranged from €10,000 to €10 million depending on the jurisdiction, and the CSRD's broader scope suggests enforcement will intensify.

## How Sustainability Consultants Help

A sustainability consultant can run your double materiality assessment, build a CSRD-ready data architecture, draft disclosures aligned to ESRS, coordinate with your assurance provider, and train internal teams. For companies new to mandatory sustainability reporting, consultants compress the learning curve from years to months and help avoid costly misstatements.

## Frequently Asked Questions

**Does the CSRD apply to non-EU companies?**
Yes. Non-EU parent companies with €150M+ in EU net turnover and at least one EU subsidiary or branch must report starting FY 2028 (reports due 2029).

**What is double materiality?**
Double materiality requires companies to assess sustainability topics from two directions: how external sustainability factors affect the business (financial materiality) and how the business affects people and the environment (impact materiality).

**Can subsidiaries be exempted?**
A subsidiary may be exempt if its parent company publishes a CSRD-compliant consolidated report that covers the subsidiary, subject to certain conditions and member state rules.

**What level of assurance is required?**
Limited assurance is required initially. The Commission plans to adopt reasonable assurance standards by October 2028.

**How does the CSRD differ from the ISSB standards?**
The CSRD uses double materiality (impact + financial), while ISSB standards (IFRS S1/S2) focus on financial materiality alone. The CSRD also mandates specific data points through ESRS, whereas ISSB is principles-based.
