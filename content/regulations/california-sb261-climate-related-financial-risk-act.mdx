## What Is SB 261?

Senate Bill 261, the Climate-Related Financial Risk Act, was signed into law on October 7, 2023, alongside SB 253. While SB 253 focuses on emissions data, SB 261 requires covered companies to publish climate-related financial risk reports in line with the recommendations of the Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures (TCFD).

SB 261 has a lower revenue threshold than SB 253 ($500 million vs. $1 billion), meaning it captures a broader set of companies. The reports must be published on the company's website every two years, starting January 1, 2026 (for the first reporting cycle). The California Air Resources Board (CARB) must publish a report on the disclosed climate risks by January 1, 2027.

Like SB 253, SB 261 was amended by SB 219 in September 2024, which adjusted certain deadlines and gave CARB additional implementation flexibility.

## Who Does It Apply To?

SB 261 covers any entity that:

- Is a corporation, partnership, LLC, or other business entity, **and**
- Does business in California (per Revenue and Taxation Code §23101), **and**
- Has total annual revenues exceeding **$500 million**

This lower threshold means companies between $500M and $1B in revenue face SB 261 obligations but not SB 253. Companies above $1B face both.

## Key Requirements

**TCFD-Aligned Risk Report:** Each covered entity must prepare a climate-related financial risk report consistent with the TCFD framework. The four TCFD pillars are:

1. **Governance** — Board and management oversight of climate risks and opportunities
2. **Strategy** — Actual and potential climate-related impacts on the organization, including scenario analysis
3. **Risk Management** — Processes for identifying, assessing, and managing climate risks
4. **Metrics and Targets** — Metrics used to assess climate risks and opportunities, including GHG emissions and climate targets

**Scenario Analysis:** TCFD recommends that companies describe their resilience under different climate scenarios, including a 2°C or lower scenario. SB 261 does not prescribe specific scenarios but expects conformance with TCFD guidance, which calls for at least two forward-looking scenarios.

**Public Disclosure:** Reports must be published on the company's own website — not filed with a regulator. CARB will review the reports and publish an aggregate analysis.

**Biennial Reporting:** Reports are due every two years, starting January 1, 2026.

## Timeline

| Milestone | Date |
|-----------|------|
| SB 261 signed into law | October 7, 2023 |
| SB 219 amendments signed | September 2024 |
| First climate risk reports due | January 1, 2026 |
| CARB aggregate analysis published | January 1, 2027 |
| Second reports due | January 1, 2028 |

## Compliance Steps

1. **Determine applicability.** Confirm the $500M revenue threshold and California nexus.
2. **Familiarize with TCFD.** Review the TCFD's Final Recommendations (June 2017), Implementation Guidance, and sector-specific supplements. Though the TCFD was disbanded in late 2023 and its monitoring transferred to the ISSB, its recommendations remain the SB 261 benchmark.
3. **Conduct a climate risk assessment.** Identify physical risks (acute events like hurricanes, chronic changes like sea level rise) and transition risks (policy, technology, market, reputation) material to your business.
4. **Run scenario analysis.** Select at least two climate scenarios (e.g., an orderly 1.5°C transition and a high-emissions 3°C+ pathway) and model financial impacts on revenue, costs, assets, and capital allocation over relevant time horizons.
5. **Draft the TCFD report.** Structure disclosures around the four pillars. Be specific — generic statements about "being committed to sustainability" will not satisfy the requirement.
6. **Publish on your website.** Ensure the report is publicly accessible, dated, and clearly labeled.
7. **Integrate with SB 253.** If you're above $1B in revenue, coordinate emissions data (used in TCFD metrics) with your SB 253 GHG disclosure.

## Penalties and Enforcement

SB 261 authorizes administrative penalties of up to **$50,000 per reporting cycle** for failure to publish the required report. This is significantly lower than SB 253's penalties, reflecting the less prescriptive nature of the requirement. CARB has enforcement authority.

## How Sustainability Consultants Help

Consultants perform climate risk assessments, run quantitative scenario analyses using tools like NGFS scenarios and IPCC pathways, draft TCFD-aligned reports, and help companies tell a credible story about their climate resilience. For companies without in-house climate modeling capability, this is not a task that can be delegated to the sustainability intern.

## Frequently Asked Questions

**How is SB 261 different from SB 253?**
SB 253 requires GHG emissions disclosure (Scopes 1, 2, 3). SB 261 requires climate-related financial risk reporting aligned with TCFD. Different information, different thresholds ($500M vs. $1B), and different formats.

**Does SB 261 require third-party assurance?**
No. Unlike SB 253, SB 261 does not mandate external assurance of the climate risk report.

**What counts as adequate scenario analysis?**
TCFD guidance calls for at least two scenarios, including one aligned with 2°C or lower warming. The analysis should be forward-looking, cover relevant time horizons for your business, and translate physical and transition risks into financial terms.

**Can we use an existing TCFD report?**
If you already publish a TCFD-aligned report (e.g., through CDP or your annual report), you may be able to satisfy SB 261 by publishing that report on your website. Verify that it meets all four TCFD pillars and covers California-specific risks where relevant.

**What if I'm subject to both SB 253 and SB 261?**
Companies above $1B face both. The emissions data required by SB 253 overlaps with the metrics/targets pillar of TCFD. Build a unified data platform and produce both disclosures from the same underlying data.
