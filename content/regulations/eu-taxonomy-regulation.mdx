  - question: "What is the EU Taxonomy?"
    answer: "The EU Taxonomy is a classification system that defines which economic activities are 'environmentally sustainable.' It provides technical screening criteria for activities that substantially contribute to one of six environmental objectives while doing no significant harm to the others. Companies subject to CSRD must report their Taxonomy-aligned revenue, CapEx, and OpEx."
  - question: "What are the six environmental objectives?"
    answer: "The six objectives are: (1) Climate change mitigation, (2) Climate change adaptation, (3) Sustainable use and protection of water and marine resources, (4) Transition to a circular economy, (5) Pollution prevention and control, (6) Protection and restoration of biodiversity and ecosystems. Technical screening criteria have been adopted for all six."
  - question: "Does the EU Taxonomy apply to non-EU companies?"
    answer: "Not directly, but non-EU companies with EU subsidiaries subject to CSRD must include Taxonomy reporting. Additionally, EU financial institutions must report the Taxonomy alignment of their portfolios, which creates demand for Taxonomy data from all companies they invest in or lend to — including non-EU companies."

## What Is the EU Taxonomy?

The EU Taxonomy Regulation (2020/852) establishes a unified classification system for environmentally sustainable economic activities across the European Union. It provides technical criteria that determine whether a specific economic activity can be classified as 'green' — creating a common language for sustainable finance and corporate disclosure.

The Taxonomy is a cornerstone of the EU's sustainable finance framework, designed to direct capital toward genuinely sustainable activities and combat greenwashing.

## Who It Applies To

- **CSRD-reporting companies**: Must disclose Taxonomy eligibility and alignment of revenue, capital expenditure, and operating expenditure
- **Financial market participants**: Must disclose Taxonomy alignment of financial products under SFDR
- **EU member states**: Must use the Taxonomy for green bonds and public measures
- **Financial institutions**: Must report the Green Asset Ratio (GAR) showing Taxonomy-aligned activities in their portfolios

## Key Requirements

**Three-step assessment:**

1. **Taxonomy eligibility**: Is your economic activity described in the Taxonomy? Not all activities are covered — only those with significant potential for environmental contribution.

2. **Substantial contribution**: Does the activity meet the Technical Screening Criteria (TSC) for at least one environmental objective? For example, electricity generation from solar PV must have lifecycle emissions below 100g CO2e/kWh.

3. **Do No Significant Harm (DNSH)**: Does the activity avoid significant harm to the other five environmental objectives? Each TSC includes specific DNSH criteria.

4. **Minimum safeguards**: Does the company comply with OECD Guidelines, UN Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights, ILO core conventions, and the International Bill of Human Rights?

**Reporting metrics:**
- Taxonomy-eligible revenue, CapEx, and OpEx as a percentage of total
- Taxonomy-aligned revenue, CapEx, and OpEx as a percentage of total
- Breakdown by environmental objective

## The Six Environmental Objectives

1. **Climate change mitigation**: Activities that reduce GHG emissions (renewable energy, energy efficiency, clean transport, green buildings)
2. **Climate change adaptation**: Activities that reduce vulnerability to climate impacts (climate-resilient infrastructure, warning systems)
3. **Water and marine resources**: Activities protecting aquatic ecosystems and water quality
4. **Circular economy**: Activities minimizing waste and keeping materials in use
5. **Pollution prevention**: Activities reducing pollution of air, water, and soil
6. **Biodiversity**: Activities protecting and restoring ecosystems

## Timeline

- **July 2020**: Taxonomy Regulation entered into force
- **January 2022**: Climate Delegated Act applied (objectives 1 & 2)
- **January 2024**: Environmental Delegated Act applied (objectives 3-6)
- **Ongoing**: Technical screening criteria are periodically reviewed and updated

## Compliance Steps

1. **Map economic activities**: Identify which of your revenue-generating activities, CapEx, and OpEx are described in the Taxonomy
2. **Assess eligibility**: Determine which mapped activities are Taxonomy-eligible
3. **Evaluate substantial contribution**: Test eligible activities against Technical Screening Criteria for the relevant environmental objective
4. **Apply DNSH criteria**: Verify that each substantially contributing activity does not significantly harm the other five objectives
5. **Verify minimum safeguards**: Confirm compliance with human rights, anti-corruption, tax, and competition requirements
6. **Calculate KPIs**: Compute Taxonomy-aligned percentages for revenue, CapEx, and OpEx
7. **Disclose in management report**: Include Taxonomy reporting as part of CSRD sustainability statement

## Penalties

Penalties follow CSRD enforcement mechanisms as Taxonomy reporting is embedded in CSRD disclosure. Additionally:
- Misrepresentation of Taxonomy alignment could constitute greenwashing
- Financial institutions face regulatory scrutiny from national supervisors
- Investment funds claiming green credentials without proper Taxonomy assessment face SFDR enforcement
