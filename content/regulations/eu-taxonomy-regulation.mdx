## What Is the EU Taxonomy?

The EU Taxonomy Regulation (Regulation 2020/852) is a classification system that defines which economic activities qualify as "environmentally sustainable" under EU law. It entered into force in July 2020 and serves as the EU's reference framework for green investment, corporate disclosure, and policy design.

The Taxonomy establishes six environmental objectives: climate change mitigation, climate change adaptation, sustainable use and protection of water and marine resources, transition to a circular economy, pollution prevention and control, and protection and restoration of biodiversity and ecosystems. An activity qualifies as Taxonomy-aligned if it makes a substantial contribution to at least one objective, does no significant harm (DNSH) to the others, and meets minimum social safeguards.

Technical screening criteria (TSC) — the specific quantitative thresholds and conditions — are set out in delegated acts. The Climate Delegated Act (covering mitigation and adaptation) has been applicable since January 2022. The Environmental Delegated Act (covering the remaining four objectives) became applicable from January 2024.

## Who Does It Apply To?

Three categories of entities have disclosure obligations under the Taxonomy:

- **Companies subject to the CSRD:** Must disclose the proportion of their turnover, capital expenditure (CapEx), and operating expenditure (OpEx) that is Taxonomy-eligible and Taxonomy-aligned.
- **Financial market participants:** Asset managers, pension funds, and insurers offering financial products in the EU must disclose the Taxonomy-alignment of their portfolios under the Sustainable Finance Disclosure Regulation (SFDR).
- **EU member states and public authorities:** Must reference the Taxonomy when setting standards for green bonds, eco-labels, and public investment criteria. The EU Green Bond Standard (EuGBS), adopted in 2023, requires that proceeds be allocated to Taxonomy-aligned activities.

## Key Requirements

**Eligibility vs. Alignment:** A critical distinction. An activity is Taxonomy-*eligible* if it is described in the delegated acts, regardless of whether it meets the criteria. It is Taxonomy-*aligned* only if it meets the substantial contribution criteria, DNSH conditions, and minimum safeguards. Companies must disclose both metrics.

**KPIs:** Non-financial companies report three key performance indicators:
- Turnover KPI: revenue from Taxonomy-aligned activities / total revenue
- CapEx KPI: capital expenditure on Taxonomy-aligned activities or CapEx plans / total CapEx
- OpEx KPI: direct non-capitalized costs related to Taxonomy-aligned activities / total qualifying OpEx

Financial institutions use different KPIs: the Green Asset Ratio (GAR) for banks, investment ratios for asset managers, and underwriting ratios for insurers.

**Minimum Safeguards:** Companies must comply with the OECD Guidelines for Multinational Enterprises, the UN Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights, the ILO Core Conventions, and the International Bill of Human Rights. The Platform on Sustainable Finance issued guidance in October 2022 on how to assess compliance.

**Do No Significant Harm (DNSH):** Each activity's TSC includes DNSH criteria for the five non-target objectives. For example, a renewable energy project must substantially contribute to climate mitigation while not harming water resources, biodiversity, or other objectives.

## Timeline

| Milestone | Date |
|-----------|------|
| Regulation entered into force | July 12, 2020 |
| Climate Delegated Act applicable | January 1, 2022 |
| First Taxonomy disclosures (eligibility only) | FY 2021 reports |
| Full alignment disclosures begin | FY 2022 reports |
| Environmental Delegated Act applicable | January 1, 2024 |
| Financial institutions full GAR reporting | FY 2024 reports (due 2025) |

## Compliance Steps

1. **Screen your activities.** Map your revenue streams, CapEx, and OpEx against the NACE codes and activity descriptions in the Climate and Environmental Delegated Acts.
2. **Assess substantial contribution.** For each eligible activity, evaluate whether it meets the quantitative and qualitative TSC.
3. **Apply DNSH criteria.** Check each activity against the DNSH conditions for the five non-target objectives. This often requires environmental impact data you may not currently collect.
4. **Verify minimum safeguards.** Assess your human rights and labor due diligence processes against the four referenced instruments.
5. **Calculate KPIs.** Build the numerator and denominator for turnover, CapEx, and OpEx ratios. Avoid double-counting.
6. **Integrate with CSRD reporting.** Taxonomy disclosures are a required element of ESRS reporting. Ensure consistency between your materiality assessment and Taxonomy analysis.

## Penalties and Enforcement

The Taxonomy Regulation itself does not specify penalties — enforcement sits with the CSRD and SFDR frameworks. Misrepresenting Taxonomy alignment in corporate reports or financial product disclosures can trigger penalties under those regimes, as well as greenwashing claims under EU consumer protection law. National financial regulators (BaFin in Germany, AMF in France, FCA in the UK for SFDR-adjacent rules) are increasingly scrutinizing green claims.

## How Sustainability Consultants Help

The Taxonomy's technical screening criteria are granular and sector-specific. Consultants map your activities to the correct NACE codes, assess substantial contribution and DNSH criteria, build the data infrastructure for KPI calculation, and help financial institutions calculate their Green Asset Ratio. For companies with diversified operations across multiple Taxonomy activities, this is a significant analytical exercise.

## Frequently Asked Questions

**What's the difference between Taxonomy-eligible and Taxonomy-aligned?**
Eligible means the activity is described in the delegated acts. Aligned means it actually meets the substantial contribution criteria, DNSH conditions, and minimum safeguards. A company can have high eligibility and low alignment.

**Does the Taxonomy apply to non-EU companies?**
Directly, only if they are subject to the CSRD. Indirectly, non-EU companies may need to provide Taxonomy data to EU investors, banks, and supply chain partners.

**What are the six environmental objectives?**
Climate mitigation, climate adaptation, water and marine resources, circular economy, pollution prevention, and biodiversity protection.

**How often do the technical screening criteria change?**
The Commission reviews and updates the delegated acts periodically. New activities are added and thresholds are revised as technology and science evolve.

**Is nuclear energy included in the Taxonomy?**
Yes. The Complementary Climate Delegated Act (effective January 2023) includes nuclear energy and natural gas under specific conditions and with enhanced disclosure requirements.
