## What Is the EPA GHGRP?

The EPA Greenhouse Gas Reporting Program (GHGRP), established under 40 CFR Part 98, has required large GHG emitters and fuel/industrial gas suppliers in the United States to report emissions data to the EPA annually since 2010 (for reporting year 2010). It was authorized by the FY2008 Consolidated Appropriations Act and implemented through rulemaking finalized in October 2009.

The GHGRP is a **data collection program**, not a cap-and-trade or emissions reduction program. It provides the U.S. government and the public with facility-level emissions data across the economy. The data is published through the EPA's Facility Level Information on GreenHouse gases Tool (FLIGHT).

As of the most recent reporting cycle, approximately 8,000 facilities report under the GHGRP, covering roughly 85% of total U.S. greenhouse gas emissions. The program covers direct emitters, fuel suppliers, industrial gas suppliers, and CO₂ injection facilities.

## Who Must Report?

Reporting is mandatory for facilities that meet **any** of the following criteria:

- **Direct emitters:** Facilities that emit 25,000 metric tons CO₂e or more per year from one or more source categories listed in the rule (41 source categories as of 2025, including power plants, refineries, cement plants, iron/steel, pulp and paper, chemicals, landfills, and wastewater treatment)
- **Fuel suppliers:** Suppliers of fossil fuels and industrial greenhouse gases that would result in 25,000 metric tons CO₂e or more when combusted or released
- **CO₂ injection facilities:** Facilities that inject CO₂ underground for geologic sequestration or enhanced oil recovery
- **Electronics manufacturers:** Facilities that manufacture certain electronics (including semiconductors) using fluorinated GHGs

Facilities below the 25,000 metric ton threshold in certain source categories may still be required to report if they belong to a source category with a lower or different threshold.

## What Gets Reported?

The GHGRP covers seven greenhouse gases: CO₂, CH₄ (methane), N₂O (nitrous oxide), HFCs, PFCs, SF₆, and NF₃. Facilities report:

- Total GHG emissions by gas, in metric tons of CO₂ equivalent
- Emissions by source category and unit
- Production data and other activity information used to calculate emissions
- Methodology and calculation approach for each source

Reporting follows EPA-prescribed calculation methodologies specific to each source category — these are detailed in the subparts of 40 CFR Part 98. Companies cannot substitute their own methodologies.

## Key Requirements

**Annual Reporting:** Reports are due by **March 31** each year for the prior calendar year's emissions. Reports are submitted electronically through the EPA's e-GGRT system.

**Monitoring and Measurement:** Depending on the source category, facilities must use continuous emissions monitoring systems (CEMS), fuel sampling and analysis, engineering calculations, or mass balance approaches as specified in the applicable subpart.

**Record Retention:** Facilities must retain records of all data, calculations, and supporting documentation for **three years**.

**Verification:** The EPA conducts data verification through electronic validation checks, comparison with other data sources, and targeted audits. The program does not require independent third-party verification (unlike CSRD or SB 253), but EPA staff review submitted data and may request corrections.

**Confidential Business Information (CBI):** Certain data elements (e.g., production volumes) can be claimed as CBI. Emissions data itself is generally public.

## Timeline

| Milestone | Date |
|-----------|------|
| Final rule published | October 30, 2009 |
| First reporting year | 2010 |
| First reports due | March 31, 2011 |
| Subsequent annual reports | March 31 each year |
| Subpart W (petroleum & natural gas) updates | Ongoing; significant methane updates in 2024 |
| IRA-related methane fee data integration | 2024–2026 |

## Compliance Steps

1. **Determine if you trigger the 25,000 MT CO₂e threshold.** Calculate emissions from applicable source categories at each facility.
2. **Identify applicable subparts.** Each source category has specific calculation, monitoring, and reporting requirements under 40 CFR Part 98.
3. **Implement monitoring equipment.** Install CEMS or establish fuel sampling and analysis protocols as required by your subpart(s).
4. **Register in e-GGRT.** Create facility accounts in the EPA's electronic reporting system. Designate a Designated Representative responsible for certification.
5. **Calculate and report by March 31.** Apply EPA-prescribed methods, complete the e-GGRT forms, and certify the submission.
6. **Respond to EPA verification requests.** The EPA may issue data quality notices or request corrections. Respond within the specified deadlines.

## Penalties and Enforcement

The Clean Air Act authorizes penalties of up to **$65,598 per day per violation** (adjusted for inflation as of 2025). Violations include failure to report, late reporting, and submitting inaccurate data. The EPA's enforcement track record includes consent agreements and civil penalties, though enforcement actions have been relatively infrequent compared to other Clean Air Act programs.

## Connection to the Inflation Reduction Act

The Inflation Reduction Act of 2022 established a methane emissions charge (the "Waste Emissions Charge") for petroleum and natural gas facilities reporting under GHGRP Subpart W. Starting in 2024 (based on 2024 emissions), facilities exceeding waste emissions thresholds pay $900/ton of methane in 2024, $1,200/ton in 2025, and $1,500/ton in 2026 and beyond. This transforms GHGRP from a pure data program into a fee-triggering mechanism for the oil and gas sector.

## How Sustainability Consultants Help

Consultants help facilities determine applicability, select correct calculation methodologies, implement monitoring systems, prepare and file annual reports, and respond to EPA verification inquiries. For multi-facility companies, consultants manage the portfolio-wide reporting process and ensure consistency. Companies that also report under voluntary frameworks (CDP, GHG Protocol) benefit from consultants who align EPA GHGRP data with corporate-level GHG inventories.

## Frequently Asked Questions

**Is the GHGRP the same as a carbon tax or cap-and-trade?**
No. The GHGRP is a reporting program only. It does not directly regulate or limit emissions. However, GHGRP data now triggers the methane waste emissions charge under the IRA for oil and gas facilities.

**Does the 25,000 MT threshold apply to my whole company?**
No. The threshold applies at the **facility level**, not the corporate level. Each facility is assessed independently.

**Can I use my own calculation methodology?**
No. You must use the EPA-prescribed methods in the applicable subpart of 40 CFR Part 98. Deviations require EPA approval through the "best available monitoring method" (BAMM) process.

**Is the data public?**
Emissions data is public and available through EPA FLIGHT. Certain production and process data may be claimed as confidential business information.

**How does GHGRP data relate to SB 253 or the SEC rule?**
GHGRP facility-level data feeds into corporate GHG inventories that are then disclosed under SB 253, the SEC rule, or voluntary frameworks. However, GHGRP covers only direct emissions from large facilities — it does not satisfy the full Scope 1/2/3 requirements of other mandates.
