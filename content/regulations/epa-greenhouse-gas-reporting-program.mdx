faqs:
  - question: "Who must report under EPA GHGRP?"
    answer: "Facilities that emit 25,000 metric tons CO2e or more per year must report. This covers approximately 8,000 facilities across sectors including power plants, refineries, chemical manufacturers, metals producers, pulp and paper mills, and others. Fuel and industrial gas suppliers above certain thresholds must also report."
  - question: "How does EPA GHGRP differ from corporate GHG reporting?"
    answer: "EPA GHGRP is facility-level reporting of direct emissions using EPA-specified methodologies. Corporate GHG reporting (GHG Protocol) covers the entire organization across all scopes. Companies may use GHGRP data as inputs to their corporate Scope 1 inventory, but GHGRP doesn't cover Scope 2 or 3."
  - question: "What happens if my facility exceeds the 25,000 tCO2e threshold?"
    answer: "You must begin reporting for the year in which you exceed the threshold. Reports are due by March 31 of the following year. You must continue reporting until your emissions fall below 15,000 tCO2e for 5 consecutive years (or below 25,000 tCO2e for 3 years)."

## What Is the EPA GHGRP?

The EPA Greenhouse Gas Reporting Program (40 CFR Part 98), established in 2009, requires large direct emitters of greenhouse gases in the United States to report their emissions annually to the EPA. The program covers approximately 8,000 facilities responsible for roughly 85-90% of US GHG emissions.

GHGRP is a facility-level reporting program distinct from corporate sustainability reporting. It provides the US government with comprehensive, standardized emissions data for policy-making, public transparency, and environmental monitoring.

## Who It Applies To

**Direct emitters (Subparts C-SS):**
- Facilities emitting 25,000 metric tons CO2e or more per year
- Covers 41 source categories including: power plants, petroleum refineries, chemical manufacturing, metals production, cement, glass, pulp and paper, food processing, waste management

**Suppliers (Subparts LL-QQ):**
- Fuel and industrial gas suppliers above specified thresholds
- Suppliers of petroleum products, natural gas, industrial gases, and CO2

## Key Requirements

- **Annual reporting**: Submit facility-level GHG emissions data to EPA by March 31 each year (for the prior calendar year)
- **Source-specific methodologies**: Use EPA-prescribed calculation methods for each source category (Subparts C through SS)
- **All six greenhouse gases**: Report CO2, CH4, N2O, HFCs, PFCs, SF6, and NF3 where applicable
- **Monitoring and measurement**: Use specified monitoring equipment, emission factors, and calculation methodologies
- **Verification**: EPA conducts data quality checks and may request additional documentation
- **Public reporting**: Most GHGRP data is publicly available through EPA's FLIGHT tool

## Covered Greenhouse Gases

- Carbon dioxide (CO2)
- Methane (CH4)
- Nitrous oxide (N2O)
- Hydrofluorocarbons (HFCs)
- Perfluorocarbons (PFCs)
- Sulfur hexafluoride (SF6)
- Nitrogen trifluoride (NF3)

All reported in metric tons of CO2 equivalent using EPA-specified Global Warming Potentials.

## Timeline

- **2009**: EPA GHGRP rule finalized
- **2010**: First year of data collection for most source categories
- **Annual**: Reports due by March 31 for prior calendar year
- **Ongoing**: EPA periodically updates methodologies and adds source categories

## Compliance Steps

1. **Determine applicability**: Calculate whether your facility exceeds the 25,000 tCO2e threshold
2. **Identify source categories**: Determine which GHGRP subparts apply to your operations
3. **Implement monitoring**: Install required monitoring equipment and establish data collection procedures
4. **Calculate emissions**: Apply EPA-specified methodologies for each source category
5. **Submit via e-GGRT**: Report through EPA's electronic Greenhouse Gas Reporting Tool
6. **Maintain records**: Keep all supporting documentation for at least 3 years
7. **Respond to EPA inquiries**: Be prepared to provide additional documentation if EPA requests verification

## Penalties

- **Civil penalties**: Up to $63,229 per day per violation (adjusted annually for inflation)
- **Criminal penalties**: For knowingly violating reporting requirements, falsifying data, or tampering with monitoring equipment
- **EPA enforcement actions**: Compliance orders, consent decrees, and injunctive relief

## How Council Fire Can Help

Council Fire helps facilities navigate EPA GHGRP compliance — from applicability assessment and monitoring setup through emissions calculation and reporting. We also integrate GHGRP data with broader corporate GHG inventories. [Contact us](https://www.councilfire.org/contact) for EPA GHGRP support.
