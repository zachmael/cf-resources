## What Is the EUDR?

The European Deforestation Regulation (Regulation 2023/1115), adopted in June 2023, prohibits placing certain commodities and derived products on the EU market — or exporting them from the EU — unless they are verified as deforestation-free and produced in compliance with the laws of the country of origin.

The EUDR replaced the earlier EU Timber Regulation (EUTR) and dramatically expanded its scope from timber alone to seven commodity groups responsible for the majority of global deforestation. The regulation uses a **cut-off date of December 31, 2020**: products must be produced on land that was not subject to deforestation or forest degradation after that date.

After a one-year postponement (announced in October 2024 due to implementation readiness concerns), the regulation applies to **large operators and traders from December 30, 2025**, and to **SMEs from June 30, 2026**.

## Who Does It Apply To?

- **Operators:** Any natural or legal person that places relevant commodities or products on the EU market or exports them from the EU for the first time. This includes manufacturers, importers, and EU producers.
- **Traders:** Any person in the supply chain other than the operator who makes relevant products available on the EU market. Large traders face operator-level obligations; SME traders have simplified requirements.

The regulation applies regardless of where the company is headquartered — if you place covered products on the EU market, you are in scope.

## Covered Commodities

Seven commodity groups and their derived products:

1. **Cattle** (including beef, leather, and gelatin)
2. **Cocoa** (including chocolate)
3. **Coffee**
4. **Oil palm** (including palm oil and palm kernel oil)
5. **Rubber** (including natural rubber products)
6. **Soya** (including soybean oil and soy meal)
7. **Wood** (including timber, pulp, paper, and furniture)

The full list of CN codes is in Annex I. Derived products include processed goods — for example, a chocolate bar, a leather handbag, or printed paper.

## Key Requirements

**Due Diligence System:** Operators must implement a due diligence system with three steps:

1. **Information gathering:** Collect geolocation coordinates of all plots of land where the commodity was produced, the quantity, the country of production, and supplier information. For cattle, this includes the identification of establishments where the animals were kept.

2. **Risk assessment:** Evaluate the risk that products are non-compliant, considering the country risk benchmarking system (the Commission will classify countries as low, standard, or high risk), complexity of the supply chain, presence of indigenous peoples, and available information on deforestation in the sourcing area.

3. **Risk mitigation:** If risk is identified as non-negligible, take adequate measures to mitigate it — additional documentation, satellite imagery analysis, third-party verification, independent audits, or supply chain restructuring.

**Deforestation-free verification:** Products must come from land not deforested after December 31, 2020. Deforestation is defined as the conversion of forest to agricultural use, using the FAO's forest definition (>0.5 hectares, >5 meters tree height, >10% canopy cover).

**Legality:** Products must be produced in compliance with all relevant legislation of the country of production, including land use rights, environmental protection, labor rights, and tax obligations.

**Traceability:** Geolocation coordinates must be provided for each plot of land. For plots >4 hectares, polygonal boundaries are required.

**Due diligence statements:** Operators must submit a due diligence statement to the EU information system before placing products on the market or exporting them.

## Timeline

| Milestone | Date |
|-----------|------|
| Regulation entered into force | June 29, 2023 |
| Cut-off date for deforestation | December 31, 2020 |
| Application for large operators/traders | December 30, 2025 |
| Application for SME operators/traders | June 30, 2026 |
| Country benchmarking system published | By December 30, 2024 (delayed) |

## Compliance Steps

1. **Map your product portfolio.** Identify which of your products contain or are derived from the seven covered commodities.
2. **Trace to plot of land.** Work with suppliers to collect geolocation coordinates for every sourcing plot. This is the most operationally challenging step — for companies sourcing from smallholders through multiple intermediaries, it requires significant supply chain investment.
3. **Assess deforestation risk.** Use satellite imagery, supplier documentation, and country risk classifications to evaluate each sourcing area.
4. **Implement mitigation measures.** For non-negligible risk: commission independent verification, obtain third-party certifications, or restructure sourcing to verified deforestation-free areas.
5. **Submit due diligence statements.** Register in the EU information system and file statements before placing products on the market.
6. **Maintain records.** Retain due diligence information for five years. Authorities can audit at any time.

## Penalties and Enforcement

Member states set penalties, which must be "effective, proportionate, and dissuasive." The regulation specifies minimum penalties including:

- Fines proportionate to the environmental damage and the value of the products — at minimum **4% of the operator's annual EU turnover**
- Confiscation of products and revenues
- Exclusion from public procurement for up to 12 months
- Temporary prohibition from placing products on the EU market

Enforcement is carried out by member state competent authorities, who must check at least 9% of operators and 9% of quantities from high-risk countries, 3% from standard-risk, and 1% from low-risk countries.

## How Sustainability Consultants Help

Consultants design due diligence systems, set up geolocation data collection from suppliers, conduct deforestation risk assessments using satellite monitoring platforms, help select and implement traceability technologies, and prepare due diligence statements. For companies with deep, fragmented supply chains (common in cocoa, coffee, and palm oil), this work is neither simple nor optional.

## Frequently Asked Questions

**What is the cut-off date?**
December 31, 2020. Products must come from land that was not deforested after this date. This is not the date the law applies — it's the date against which deforestation-free status is assessed.

**Does the EUDR apply to products already on the EU market?**
No. It applies to products placed on the market or exported after the application date (December 30, 2025 for large operators).

**What counts as "deforestation"?**
Conversion of forest to agricultural use. The regulation uses the FAO forest definition: land spanning >0.5 hectares with trees >5 meters and canopy cover >10%.

**Can certifications substitute for due diligence?**
No certification scheme automatically satisfies EUDR requirements. However, credible certifications (e.g., FSC, RSPO) can be used as part of the risk assessment and mitigation process. The operator remains ultimately responsible.

**What if my supplier can't provide geolocation data?**
You cannot place the product on the EU market without it. This is a hard requirement. Companies are investing in supplier engagement, traceability platforms, and sourcing restructuring to meet it.
