## What Are the UK SDR?

The UK's Sustainability Disclosure Requirements (SDR) are an evolving framework combining several regulatory streams under the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) and the UK Government. The SDR encompasses:

1. **Mandatory TCFD-aligned disclosures** — already in force for premium-listed companies, large private companies, and regulated financial services firms
2. **FCA sustainability labeling and disclosure regime for investment products** — finalized in November 2023, effective from 2024–2025
3. **Planned UK adoption of ISSB standards** — the UK Sustainability Disclosure Standards (UK SDS), expected to apply from FY 2026 onward

These layers build on each other. The UK was the first G20 country to mandate TCFD disclosures (starting 2021–2022), and it is now transitioning from TCFD to ISSB-based standards, which subsume TCFD.

## Who Does It Apply To?

**TCFD mandates (already in force):**
- Premium-listed companies on the London Stock Exchange (from April 2022)
- UK-registered companies with 500+ employees and £500M+ turnover (from April 2023, under Companies Act amendment)
- Banks, insurers, and FCA-regulated asset managers above specified thresholds
- UK occupational pension schemes with £1B+ in assets

**FCA product labeling regime (from 2024):**
- UK-authorized asset managers that market sustainability-focused investment products
- Four labels: Sustainability Focus, Sustainability Improvers, Sustainability Impact, and Sustainability Mixed Goals
- Anti-greenwashing rule applicable to all FCA-regulated firms from May 31, 2024

**UK SDS (planned):**
- The UK Government endorsed the ISSB standards in August 2023 and asked the UK Endorsement Board to assess them
- Expected to apply initially to publicly traded companies, large private companies, and financial institutions, mirroring the existing TCFD scope
- FY 2026 is the earliest expected mandatory application date, subject to legislation

## Key Requirements

**TCFD Disclosures:** Companies must report against all four TCFD pillars — governance, strategy, risk management, and metrics/targets. Premium-listed companies must comply on a "comply or explain" basis; other in-scope entities have mandatory requirements under various UK regulations (Companies Act, FCA rules, DWP regulations).

**FCA Investment Labels:** Asset managers applying a sustainability label must:
- Meet qualifying criteria specific to the chosen label (e.g., 70%+ of a fund's assets must meet the sustainability objective for the "Focus" label)
- Publish pre-contractual disclosures, ongoing performance reports, and entity-level disclosures
- Use the label name in marketing materials (no custom terminology)
- Comply with the anti-greenwashing rule — all sustainability claims must be fair, clear, and not misleading

**Anti-Greenwashing Rule:** Effective May 31, 2024, this applies to all FCA-regulated firms, not just those using labels. Any sustainability-related claim in a communication to UK clients must be consistent with the product's actual sustainability profile.

**UK SDS (anticipated):** The UK Endorsement Board is assessing IFRS S1 and S2 for UK adoption. The resulting UK SDS may include modifications (e.g., requiring Scope 3 disclosure from year one rather than using the ISSB's one-year relief). Companies should prepare for ISSB-equivalent requirements.

## Timeline

| Milestone | Date |
|-----------|------|
| TCFD mandatory for premium-listed companies | April 2022 |
| TCFD mandatory for large UK companies | April 2023 |
| FCA anti-greenwashing rule effective | May 31, 2024 |
| FCA sustainability labels available | July 31, 2024 |
| FCA entity-level disclosures required | December 2, 2025 |
| UK SDS expected mandatory start | FY 2026 (subject to legislation) |

## Compliance Steps

1. **Confirm your regulatory scope.** Identify which SDR streams apply — TCFD mandates, FCA product labeling, or both.
2. **Review existing TCFD disclosures.** If you're already reporting, gap-check against best practice. The FCA's published feedback letters highlight common weaknesses: vague scenario analysis, missing Scope 3 data, and disconnected governance disclosures.
3. **Assess product labeling needs.** If you manage UK-marketed funds, evaluate which (if any) qualify for a sustainability label. Misapplying a label triggers regulatory risk.
4. **Prepare for UK SDS.** Begin aligning with IFRS S1 and S2 now. Build Scope 3 data pipelines, run climate scenario analysis, and connect sustainability disclosures to financial reporting cycles.
5. **Train client-facing teams.** The anti-greenwashing rule means any sustainability claim in marketing, pitch decks, or client communications must be substantiated. Sales and marketing teams need training.
6. **Document your methodology.** UK regulators expect transparency about data sources, estimation approaches, and limitations — particularly for Scope 3 and scenario analysis.

## Penalties and Enforcement

- **TCFD non-compliance:** The FCA can impose fines, public censure, and supervisory actions on regulated firms. For companies reporting under the Companies Act, failure to include required climate disclosures in the strategic report may result in director liability.
- **Labeling and anti-greenwashing violations:** The FCA has enforcement powers including fines and product withdrawal. In 2024, the FCA issued a "Dear CEO" letter warning asset managers about unsubstantiated ESG claims.
- **UK SDS:** Enforcement mechanisms will be defined in the adopting legislation, likely mirroring existing financial reporting enforcement.

## How Sustainability Consultants Help

Consultants help UK companies produce TCFD reports that meet FCA expectations, assess fund eligibility for sustainability labels, build ISSB-ready disclosure processes, and train teams on anti-greenwashing compliance. For asset managers, the intersection of product labeling, entity-level disclosure, and anti-greenwashing rules creates a compliance matrix that benefits from structured expert guidance.

## Frequently Asked Questions

**Is the UK still using TCFD?**
Yes, for now. TCFD disclosures remain mandatory. The UK plans to transition to UK SDS (based on ISSB standards) starting FY 2026, which will subsume TCFD requirements.

**Do the FCA sustainability labels apply to non-UK managers?**
The labeling regime applies to UK-authorized fund managers. Non-UK managers marketing into the UK may be subject to the anti-greenwashing rule and naming/marketing restrictions even without a label.

**How does the UK SDR differ from the EU CSRD?**
The UK uses financial materiality (ISSB approach); the EU uses double materiality. The UK has a separate product labeling regime; the EU uses SFDR. The UK SDR is less prescriptive on specific data points than the CSRD's ESRS.

**What happens if I use a sustainability label incorrectly?**
The FCA can require you to remove the label, issue fines, and publish enforcement notices. Product marketing that misleads investors is a serious regulatory matter.

**When will Scope 3 be required in the UK?**
Under ISSB standards (which the UK plans to adopt), Scope 3 is required but with a possible one-year transition relief. The UK Endorsement Board may modify this. Prepare for Scope 3 from day one.
