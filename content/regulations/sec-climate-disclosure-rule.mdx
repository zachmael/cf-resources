## What Is the SEC Climate Disclosure Rule?

In March 2024, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission adopted final rules requiring publicly traded companies to disclose climate-related information in their registration statements and annual reports. The rule, formally titled "The Enhancement and Standardization of Climate-Related Disclosures for Investors," drew heavily from the Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures (TCFD) framework.

The SEC's stated rationale: investors need consistent, comparable, and reliable climate data to make informed capital allocation decisions. The rule addresses governance, strategy, risk management, targets, greenhouse gas emissions, and the financial impact of severe weather events and transition activities.

However, the rule has faced significant legal challenges. In April 2024, the SEC voluntarily stayed the rule pending resolution of consolidated legal challenges in the Eighth Circuit Court of Appeals. As of early 2026, the rule remains stayed, and its ultimate fate depends on court rulings and the posture of SEC leadership.

## Who Does It Apply To?

All SEC registrants — domestic issuers and foreign private issuers that file annual reports with the SEC. The rule uses the existing filer categories to phase in requirements:

- **Large Accelerated Filers (LAFs):** Public float ≥ $700M. Earliest compliance.
- **Accelerated Filers (AFs):** Public float $75M–$700M. Phased in after LAFs.
- **Non-Accelerated Filers, Smaller Reporting Companies, and Emerging Growth Companies:** Later phase-in with some exemptions, including no Scope 1/2 emissions disclosure requirement.

## Key Requirements (as Adopted)

**Governance:** Disclose the board's oversight of climate-related risks and management's role in assessing and managing those risks.

**Strategy:** Describe climate-related risks that have materially impacted or are reasonably likely to materially impact the business, including physical risks and transition risks. If the company uses scenario analysis, describe the scenarios and assumptions.

**Risk Management:** Describe processes for identifying, assessing, and managing climate-related risks and how they integrate with overall risk management.

**GHG Emissions:** LAFs and AFs must disclose Scope 1 and Scope 2 emissions, subject to materiality. LAFs must obtain third-party attestation (limited assurance initially, reasonable assurance later). The final rule dropped the proposed Scope 3 requirement.

**Financial Statement Disclosures:** Companies must disclose the financial impacts of severe weather events and other natural conditions in a note to audited financial statements if the costs exceed 1% of the related financial statement line item. Capitalized costs and expenditures related to carbon offsets and renewable energy credits must also be disclosed if material.

**Targets and Goals:** If a company has set climate-related targets or goals, it must disclose them along with progress.

## Timeline (as Originally Adopted, Currently Stayed)

| Filer Category | GHG Emissions Disclosure | Attestation (Limited) | Attestation (Reasonable) |
|---|---|---|---|
| Large Accelerated Filer | FY 2026 | FY 2029 | FY 2033 |
| Accelerated Filer | FY 2028 | FY 2031 | N/A |
| SRC / Non-Accelerated | Exempt | Exempt | Exempt |

Note: All dates are subject to the outcome of ongoing litigation and the voluntary stay.

## Compliance Steps

1. **Monitor the litigation.** Track the Eighth Circuit proceedings and SEC guidance. The rule could be upheld, modified, remanded, or vacated.
2. **Map existing disclosures.** Many companies already report climate data via CDP, TCFD, or state-level mandates. Inventory what you have.
3. **Assess Scope 1 and 2 data readiness.** Even if the rule is delayed, the direction is clear. Build robust GHG accounting systems now using the GHG Protocol.
4. **Evaluate financial statement impacts.** Work with your audit team to identify severe weather costs and transition-related expenditures that hit the 1% threshold.
5. **Engage attestation providers.** The pool of qualified GHG attestation providers is limited. Early engagement secures capacity and better pricing.
6. **Align with state mandates.** California's SB 253 and SB 261 have their own timelines and requirements. A unified approach reduces duplication.

## Penalties and Enforcement

Standard SEC enforcement mechanisms apply: comment letters on filings, enforcement actions for material misstatements or omissions, and potential personal liability for officers who certify false or misleading disclosures. Given the political sensitivity, enforcement posture will depend heavily on SEC leadership priorities.

## How Sustainability Consultants Help

Consultants can perform a readiness assessment against the SEC rule's specific disclosure requirements, build GHG inventories to attestation-grade quality, prepare financial statement impact analyses, and coordinate between sustainability, legal, finance, and audit teams. For companies that have never disclosed emissions in SEC filings, the gap between voluntary reporting quality and SEC-grade disclosure is significant.

## Frequently Asked Questions

**Is the SEC climate rule currently in effect?**
No. The SEC voluntarily stayed the rule in April 2024 pending litigation in the Eighth Circuit. Compliance dates are suspended.

**Does the rule require Scope 3 emissions disclosure?**
No. The final rule dropped the Scope 3 requirement that was in the proposed version. Only Scope 1 and Scope 2 are required, and only for LAFs and AFs.

**Should companies prepare even though the rule is stayed?**
Yes. The underlying data requirements overlap with California's SB 253, the EU's CSRD, and ISSB standards. Preparation is not wasted effort regardless of this rule's outcome.

**What's the 1% threshold for financial statements?**
Companies must disclose the financial impact of severe weather events and natural conditions if costs exceed 1% of the pre-tax income or relevant line item. This is in a footnote to audited financials.

**Does it apply to foreign private issuers?**
Yes. Foreign private issuers that file annual reports with the SEC are within scope, though they may use home-country reporting frameworks if substantially similar.
