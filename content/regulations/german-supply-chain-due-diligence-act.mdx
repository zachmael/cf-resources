## What Is the LkSG?

The Lieferkettensorgfaltspflichtengesetz (LkSG), or Supply Chain Due Diligence Act, took effect on January 1, 2023. It requires covered companies to identify, prevent, mitigate, and account for human rights and environmental risks in their own operations and their direct suppliers' operations — with certain obligations extending to indirect suppliers when the company has substantiated knowledge of a violation.

Germany was among the first major economies to enact a standalone supply chain due diligence law. The LkSG draws on the UN Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights and the OECD Guidelines for Multinational Enterprises.

The Federal Office for Economic Affairs and Export Control (BAFA) is the designated enforcement authority. As of mid-2025, BAFA had initiated over 30 review proceedings and published extensive guidance on risk analysis methodology, complaints mechanisms, and sector-specific risks.

## Who Does It Apply To?

The LkSG applies based on employee count and German headquarters or principal place of business:

- **From January 1, 2023:** Companies with their head office, principal place of business, or administrative seat in Germany and **3,000+ employees**
- **From January 1, 2024:** Threshold lowered to **1,000+ employees**

Employees include temporary workers employed for more than six months. German subsidiaries of foreign parent companies are in scope if they independently meet the threshold. Employees of affiliated companies (Konzern) may be aggregated under certain circumstances.

Approximately 4,800 companies fell within scope by 2024. While the law directly applies to German-based companies, their obligations cascade to suppliers globally.

## Key Requirements

**Risk Management System:** Establish an adequate and effective risk management system integrated into all relevant business processes.

**Risk Analysis:** Conduct annual risk analysis of your own operations and direct suppliers. The analysis must be event-driven — repeated when circumstances change (e.g., new supplier onboarding, entering new markets, or evidence of violations).

**Preventive Measures:**
- Adopt a policy statement on human rights strategy, approved at management level
- Implement procurement practices that prevent or mitigate identified risks (e.g., contractual clauses, training, supplier audits)
- For your own operations: establish internal compliance procedures, training, and controls

**Remedial Action:** If a violation occurs or is imminent, take immediate remedial action — this may include suspending or terminating a supplier relationship as a last resort.

**Complaints Mechanism:** Establish an accessible complaints procedure allowing affected persons (including third-party workers in the supply chain) to report human rights and environmental concerns. The mechanism must be publicly accessible, confidential, and effective.

**Documentation and Reporting:** Prepare an annual report on due diligence activities, risks identified, and measures taken. Submit the report to BAFA and publish it on the company's website within four months of the fiscal year end. Reports must be retained for seven years.

**Indirect Suppliers:** Due diligence obligations extend to indirect (sub-tier) suppliers when the company has **substantiated knowledge** of a possible violation. In such cases, the company must conduct a risk analysis of the indirect supplier, implement preventive measures, and create a concept for minimization.

## Protected Rights and Environmental Standards

The LkSG references specific international conventions:
- Prohibition of child labor (ILO Conventions 138, 182)
- Prohibition of forced labor (ILO Conventions 29, 105)
- Freedom of association and collective bargaining (ILO Conventions 87, 98)
- Prohibition of discrimination (ILO Conventions 100, 111)
- Adequate wages, working hours, and occupational health/safety
- Environmental protections related to mercury (Minamata Convention), persistent organic pollutants (Stockholm Convention), and hazardous waste (Basel Convention)

## Timeline

| Milestone | Date |
|-----------|------|
| LkSG adopted by Bundestag | June 11, 2021 |
| In force for companies with 3,000+ employees | January 1, 2023 |
| In force for companies with 1,000+ employees | January 1, 2024 |
| First annual reports due (3,000+ cohort) | By April 30, 2024 (for FY 2023) |
| First annual reports due (1,000+ cohort) | By April 30, 2025 (for FY 2024) |

## Compliance Steps

1. **Confirm applicability.** Count employees (including temps >6 months) at German entities. Check Konzern aggregation rules.
2. **Appoint a human rights officer.** The LkSG requires a designated responsible person or team within the company.
3. **Map your supply chain.** Identify direct suppliers and high-risk indirect suppliers by country, sector, and commodity.
4. **Conduct risk analysis.** Apply BAFA's methodology — assess abstract risk (country/sector level) and concrete risk (supplier-specific indicators). Prioritize risks by severity and likelihood.
5. **Implement preventive measures.** Integrate due diligence into procurement contracts, supplier codes of conduct, training, and audit programs.
6. **Establish a complaints mechanism.** Make it accessible in relevant languages, publicize it to affected stakeholders, and assign internal resources to investigate complaints.
7. **Document everything.** BAFA expects detailed documentation of your risk analysis, measures taken, and effectiveness reviews. Prepare the annual report.

## Penalties and Enforcement

BAFA can impose fines of up to **€8 million** or up to **2% of average annual global turnover** (for companies with >€400M turnover). Additionally, companies fined €175,000 or more can be excluded from public procurement contracts for up to three years.

BAFA has taken an active enforcement posture — issuing questionnaires, conducting audits, and publishing sectoral guidance. The agency can also order specific remedial measures.

## How Sustainability Consultants Help

Consultants design and implement supply chain due diligence programs, conduct risk analyses using BAFA-aligned methodology, build complaints mechanisms, train procurement teams, and prepare annual reports. For companies with thousands of direct suppliers across dozens of countries, the risk mapping exercise alone requires dedicated analytical resources.

## Frequently Asked Questions

**Does the LkSG apply to non-German companies?**
Only if they have a registered branch or principal place of business in Germany with the required employee count. However, non-German suppliers are indirectly affected through their German customers' due diligence obligations.

**What is "substantiated knowledge" for indirect suppliers?**
It means credible information — from your complaints mechanism, media reports, NGO research, or government alerts — that a human rights or environmental violation may be occurring at a sub-tier supplier.

**Will the EU CSDDD replace the LkSG?**
The EU Corporate Sustainability Due Diligence Directive (CSDDD) was adopted in 2024 and must be transposed by member states by July 2026. Germany will likely amend the LkSG to align with the CSDDD, which has a broader scope including civil liability provisions.

**Do I need to audit every supplier?**
No. The LkSG follows a risk-based approach. You must conduct risk analysis and apply proportionate measures. Not every supplier needs a physical audit — desk-based assessments, certifications, and contractual provisions are legitimate tools.

**How does the complaints mechanism work?**
It must be accessible to affected persons (not just employees), confidential, transparent about the process, and operated by impartial persons. Many companies use third-party whistleblowing platforms to meet these requirements.
