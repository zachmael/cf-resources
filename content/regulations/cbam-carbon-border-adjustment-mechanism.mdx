## What Is CBAM?

The Carbon Border Adjustment Mechanism (CBAM) is the EU's tool for putting a carbon price on imported goods. Established by Regulation 2023/956 and effective from October 1, 2023, CBAM is designed to prevent "carbon leakage" — the risk that EU manufacturers relocate production to countries with weaker carbon pricing, undermining the EU Emissions Trading System (ETS).

CBAM works by requiring EU importers to purchase certificates corresponding to the carbon price that would have been paid if the goods had been produced under the EU ETS. If the exporter already paid a carbon price in their home country, that amount is deducted.

The mechanism is rolling out in two phases: a transitional reporting period (October 2023 – December 2025) and a definitive financial phase starting January 1, 2026.

## Who Does It Apply To?

CBAM applies to **EU importers** of goods in these sectors:

- **Cement**
- **Iron and steel**
- **Aluminum**
- **Fertilizers**
- **Electricity**
- **Hydrogen** (added in the final regulation)

The regulation covers both the base materials and certain downstream products (e.g., screws, bolts, and tubes made from iron or steel). The full list of CN (Combined Nomenclature) codes is in Annex I of the regulation.

Non-EU exporters are not directly regulated, but they bear an indirect impact: EU importers will favor suppliers who can demonstrate lower embedded emissions, and the cost of CBAM certificates will affect the competitiveness of carbon-intensive imports.

## Key Requirements

**Transitional Period (Oct 2023 – Dec 2025):** Importers must submit quarterly CBAM reports to the EU's CBAM registry. Reports must include the quantity of imported goods, the direct and indirect embedded emissions, and any carbon price already paid in the country of origin. No financial payments are required during the transition.

**Definitive Period (Jan 2026 onward):**
- Importers must be authorized as "CBAM declarants" by their member state's competent authority.
- By May 31 each year, declarants must submit an annual CBAM declaration covering the prior calendar year's imports.
- Declarants must surrender CBAM certificates equal to the embedded emissions of their imports. Certificate prices track the weekly average EU ETS auction price.
- Free allocation under the EU ETS for domestic producers of CBAM-covered goods will be phased out from 2026 to 2034, increasing the effective cost differential that CBAM offsets.

**Emissions Calculation:** Embedded emissions include direct emissions from production and, for certain goods, indirect emissions from electricity consumed. Default values published by the European Commission may be used during the transition, but actual emissions data is preferred and will eventually be required.

**Verification:** From 2026, embedded emissions data must be verified by accredited verifiers.

| First annual declaration due | May 31, 2027 (for CY 2026) |
| EU ETS free allocation phase-out | 2026–2034 |

## Compliance Steps

1. **Classify your imports.** Check whether any of your imported goods fall under CBAM CN codes in Annex I.
2. **Register in the CBAM transitional registry.** EU importers must register and submit quarterly reports during the transition.
3. **Collect emissions data from suppliers.** Request actual embedded emissions data from non-EU producers. Where unavailable, use the Commission's default values (noting that defaults will become less favorable over time).
4. **Apply for CBAM declarant status.** Before January 2026, apply to your member state authority for authorization as a CBAM declarant.
5. **Purchase CBAM certificates.** Estimate your annual certificate needs based on import volumes and embedded emissions. Certificates are purchased from the member state authority at the weekly EU ETS price.
6. **Engage verifiers.** Contract with an accredited verifier to verify your embedded emissions calculations before the annual declaration deadline.

## Penalties and Enforcement

During the transitional period, penalties apply for late or incorrect reporting — up to €50 per tonne of unreported emissions. During the definitive period, failure to surrender sufficient CBAM certificates triggers a penalty equal to the EU ETS excess emissions penalty (currently €100/tonne, adjusted for inflation), plus the obligation to purchase and surrender the missing certificates.

Member state authorities are responsible for enforcement, with coordination by the European Commission.

## How Sustainability Consultants Help

Consultants help importers classify goods under CBAM CN codes, build supplier engagement programs for actual emissions data collection, calculate embedded emissions using approved methodologies, prepare quarterly and annual CBAM declarations, and model the financial impact of certificate costs on procurement strategy. For companies with complex supply chains spanning multiple non-EU countries, this is a substantial operational challenge.

## Frequently Asked Questions

**Does CBAM apply to all imports into the EU?**
No. Only imports of cement, iron/steel, aluminum, fertilizers, electricity, and hydrogen (and certain downstream products) are covered.

**What if my supplier can't provide actual emissions data?**
You may use default values published by the European Commission during the transitional period. From 2026, default values can still be used but may overestimate emissions, increasing your certificate costs. The incentive is to obtain actual data.

**How are CBAM certificate prices determined?**
Prices are set weekly based on the average closing price of EU ETS allowances at auction. As of early 2026, EU ETS prices have fluctuated between €55 and €75 per tonne.

**Will CBAM expand to other sectors?**
The regulation includes a review clause. The Commission will assess whether to extend CBAM to other goods, including downstream products and organic chemicals, by 2030.

**How does CBAM interact with carbon taxes in exporting countries?**
If a carbon price was explicitly paid in the country of origin (not indirect costs), the importer can deduct that amount when calculating the CBAM certificates required. This requires documentation and verification.
