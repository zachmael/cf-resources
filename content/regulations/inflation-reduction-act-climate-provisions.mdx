  - question: "How much funding does the IRA provide for climate?"
    answer: "The IRA allocates approximately $369 billion for energy security and climate change provisions over 10 years. However, because many incentives are uncapped tax credits, independent analyses estimate total climate spending could reach $800 billion to $1.2 trillion as adoption exceeds initial projections."
  - question: "What are the key IRA tax credits for businesses?"
    answer: "Major business tax credits include: Section 45Y Clean Electricity Production Tax Credit, Section 48E Clean Electricity Investment Tax Credit, Section 45X Advanced Manufacturing Production Tax Credit, Section 45V Clean Hydrogen Production Tax Credit, and Section 179D Energy Efficient Commercial Buildings Deduction. Many credits include bonus adders for domestic content, energy communities, and prevailing wage/apprenticeship compliance."
  - question: "Does the IRA include penalties or mandates?"
    answer: "The IRA includes a methane emissions charge for oil and gas facilities exceeding waste emissions thresholds — the first federal fee on GHG emissions. It also tightens EPA enforcement funding and includes provisions that indirectly create compliance obligations. However, most IRA provisions are incentive-based rather than punitive."

## What Is the Inflation Reduction Act?

The Inflation Reduction Act (IRA), signed into law in August 2022, represents the largest climate investment in US history. Its energy security and climate provisions allocate approximately $369 billion (with uncapped credits likely exceeding $800 billion) for clean energy, transportation electrification, sustainable manufacturing, and environmental justice.

The IRA operates primarily through tax incentives, grants, and loans rather than mandates — making it an incentive-driven approach to decarbonization that creates enormous business opportunities.

## Who It Applies To

The IRA's climate provisions affect virtually every sector:
- **Energy companies**: Renewable energy production, storage, hydrogen, nuclear, carbon capture
- **Manufacturers**: Clean energy component manufacturing, electric vehicles
- **Commercial real estate**: Energy efficiency, clean energy installations
- **Transportation**: EV purchases, fleet electrification, sustainable aviation fuel
- **Agriculture**: Conservation, climate-smart practices, rural energy
- **Communities**: Environmental justice, energy community investments
- **Financial institutions**: Clean energy tax credit transferability creates new investment markets

## Key Provisions

**Clean energy tax credits:**
- **Section 45Y/48E**: Technology-neutral clean electricity production and investment tax credits (replacing PTC/ITC from 2025)
- **Section 45V**: Clean hydrogen production tax credit ($0.60-$3.00/kg based on lifecycle emissions)
- **Section 45Q**: Enhanced carbon capture tax credit ($85/tonne for geological storage, $60/tonne for utilization)
- **Section 45X**: Advanced manufacturing production tax credit for US-made solar, wind, battery, and critical mineral components

**Transportation electrification:**
- **Section 30D**: Clean vehicle tax credit up to $7,500 for new EVs meeting domestic assembly and critical mineral requirements
- **Section 25E**: Previously owned clean vehicle credit up to $4,000
- **Section 45W**: Commercial clean vehicle credit up to $40,000 for commercial EVs

**Buildings and efficiency:**
- **Section 179D**: Enhanced commercial building energy efficiency deduction (up to $5/sq ft)
- **Section 25C**: Residential energy efficiency tax credits for heat pumps, insulation, windows
- **Section 48E bonus**: Solar, storage, and other clean energy on commercial buildings

**Environmental justice and communities:**
- **Greenhouse Gas Reduction Fund**: $27 billion for green financing, especially in disadvantaged communities
- **Environmental and Climate Justice Block Grants**: $3 billion for community-led projects
- **Energy community bonus credits**: Additional 10% tax credit for projects in energy communities

**Agriculture and land use:**
- Conservation programs funding increase ($19.5 billion)
- Climate-smart agriculture incentives
- Rural energy programs

## Bonus Credit Adders

Many IRA credits include bonus provisions that can significantly increase value:
- **Prevailing wage and apprenticeship**: 5x base credit amount for meeting labor standards
- **Domestic content**: Additional 10% bonus for US-manufactured components
- **Energy community**: Additional 10% bonus for projects in coal communities or brownfields
- **Low-income community**: Additional 10-20% bonus for projects in low-income areas

## Methane Emissions Charge

Starting 2024, the IRA imposes a charge on oil and gas facilities exceeding waste methane emissions thresholds:
- **2024**: $900/tonne of methane above threshold
- **2025**: $1,200/tonne
- **2026+**: $1,500/tonne
- Exempts facilities emitting less than 25,000 tCO2e and those in compliance with EPA methane regulations

## Timeline

- **August 2022**: IRA signed into law
- **2023-2024**: Treasury and IRS issued proposed and final guidance on major provisions
- **2024**: Methane fee begins; most tax credits available
- **2025**: Technology-neutral credits (45Y/48E) replace technology-specific credits
- **Through 2032+**: Most credits available for 10+ years, providing investment certainty
