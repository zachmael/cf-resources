## What Is the IRA?

The Inflation Reduction Act (IRA), signed into law on August 16, 2022, represents the largest climate and energy investment in U.S. history — approximately $369 billion in energy security and climate spending over ten years. While most of the IRA's climate provisions are incentive-based (tax credits, grants, and loans), the law also includes the first-ever U.S. federal fee on greenhouse gas emissions: the methane Waste Emissions Charge.

For businesses, the IRA creates both compliance obligations (for the methane charge) and significant financial opportunities (through tax credits for clean energy, manufacturing, and decarbonization activities).

## Key Climate Provisions

### Tax Credits for Clean Energy

**Production Tax Credit (PTC) — §45/§45Y:** Credit per kilowatt-hour for electricity generated from qualifying clean energy sources. For projects beginning construction after 2024, the technology-neutral §45Y clean electricity PTC applies. Base credit: 0.3¢/kWh; bonus credit: 1.5¢/kWh for projects meeting prevailing wage and apprenticeship requirements.

**Investment Tax Credit (ITC) — §48/§48E:** Credit as a percentage of investment in qualifying clean energy property. Base credit: 6% of cost; bonus credit: 30% for projects meeting labor requirements. Additional 10% bonuses available for projects in energy communities or using domestic content.

**Clean Vehicle Credits — §30D/§45W:** Up to $7,500 for new qualifying electric vehicles and $4,000 for used EVs. Eligibility depends on vehicle assembly location, battery component sourcing, and critical mineral sourcing — with requirements tightening annually.

**§45Q Carbon Capture Credit:** $85/ton for CO₂ permanently stored in geologic formations; $60/ton for CO₂ used in enhanced oil recovery or other qualifying uses. $180/ton for direct air capture with geologic storage.

**§45V Clean Hydrogen Credit:** Up to $3/kg for clean hydrogen production, tiered by lifecycle GHG intensity. Projects must meet additionality, deliverability, and temporal matching requirements per Treasury guidance.

**§45X Advanced Manufacturing Credit:** Credit for domestic production of components used in clean energy systems — solar cells, battery cells, inverters, wind components, and critical minerals processing.

### Methane Waste Emissions Charge

Section 136 of the Clean Air Act (as amended by the IRA) imposes a charge on methane emissions from petroleum and natural gas facilities reporting under EPA GHGRP Subpart W:

- **2024 emissions:** $900/ton of methane above the waste emissions threshold
- **2025 emissions:** $1,200/ton
- **2026+ emissions:** $1,500/ton

The threshold is set at 25,000 metric tons CO₂e for most facilities, with different thresholds for specific segments (e.g., onshore production). Facilities that meet EPA's regulatory requirements for methane emissions reduction (under pending Clean Air Act §111 standards) may be exempt.

### Grants and Loans

- **EPA Greenhouse Gas Reduction Fund:** $27 billion for a national green bank and competitive grants for clean energy projects in disadvantaged communities
- **USDA Rural Energy:** Expanded funding for rural clean energy and efficiency projects
- **DOE Loan Programs Office:** Expanded loan authority for clean energy manufacturing and deployment

## Who Does It Apply To?

- **Methane charge:** Petroleum and natural gas facilities reporting 25,000+ MT CO₂e under GHGRP Subpart W
- **Tax credits:** Available to a broad range of entities — utilities, project developers, manufacturers, commercial building owners, auto buyers, hydrogen producers, and (for the first time via direct pay/transferability) tax-exempt entities, state/local governments, tribal nations, and rural cooperatives
- **Grants:** Varies by program — many target small businesses, disadvantaged communities, and rural areas

## Timeline

| Provision | Key Date |
|-----------|----------|
| IRA signed into law | August 16, 2022 |
| Most tax credits effective | January 1, 2023 |
| Technology-neutral PTC/ITC (§45Y/§48E) | Projects after December 31, 2024 |
| Methane charge — first year | 2024 emissions (charge assessed ~2025) |
| Clean vehicle critical mineral requirements tighten | Annually through 2029 |
| Many credits phase down | When U.S. power sector GHG targets are met or 2032, whichever is later |

## Compliance and Optimization Steps

1. **Assess methane exposure.** If you operate oil and gas facilities, calculate your waste emissions against the threshold. Model the cost impact of $900–$1,500/ton charges and evaluate methane reduction investments.
2. **Inventory eligible tax credits.** Map your capital expenditure plans against IRA credits — clean energy projects, manufacturing, vehicle fleets, building efficiency, hydrogen production, and carbon capture.
3. **Meet labor requirements.** To qualify for the 5x bonus rates on PTC and ITC, ensure prevailing wage compliance and registered apprenticeship participation. Document compliance contemporaneously.
4. **Maximize bonus credits.** Evaluate domestic content sourcing for the 10% bonus and project siting in energy communities for an additional 10% bonus.
5. **Consider direct pay and transferability.** Tax-exempt entities can elect direct pay (receiving the credit as a cash payment). Taxable entities can sell credits to third parties via transferability, creating new financing structures.
6. **Track Treasury guidance.** IRA implementation is driven by Treasury/IRS proposed and final rules. Guidance on §45V hydrogen, §45Y/§48E technology neutrality, and domestic content is still evolving.

## Penalties and Enforcement

The methane charge is assessed and collected by the EPA. Failure to report under GHGRP triggers Clean Air Act penalties (up to $65,598/day). Tax credit claims are subject to IRS audit, and improper claims can result in recapture, penalties, and interest. Treasury has established specific recapture rules for credits where projects fail to maintain compliance over the credit period.

## How Sustainability Consultants Help

Consultants model the financial impact of IRA incentives on capital projects, identify eligible tax credits and bonus adders, design methane reduction strategies to minimize waste emissions charges, assist with prevailing wage/apprenticeship documentation, and help companies structure direct pay and transferability transactions. The IRA's complexity — spanning Treasury, IRS, EPA, DOE, and USDA — creates significant value for advisors who understand the full stack of incentives and obligations.

## Frequently Asked Questions

**Is the IRA a regulation or an incentive program?**
Mostly incentive-based (tax credits, grants, loans), but the methane waste emissions charge is a direct regulatory cost on oil and gas facilities.

**Can non-profits use IRA tax credits?**
Yes. The direct pay (elective pay) provision allows tax-exempt entities — including non-profits, municipalities, tribal governments, and co-ops — to receive the value of certain credits as a direct cash payment.

**What are prevailing wage and apprenticeship requirements?**
For projects over 1 MW, the 5x bonus credit rate requires paying workers at least the local prevailing wage (per DOL wage determinations) and ensuring a percentage of labor hours are performed by registered apprentices (starting at 12.5%, rising to 15%).

**Will the IRA tax credits survive political changes?**
The credits are codified in the Internal Revenue Code and would require legislative repeal. Attempts to repeal have faced resistance, partly because many IRA-funded projects are in politically diverse districts. However, administrative guidance and enforcement posture can shift.

**How does the methane charge interact with EPA methane regulations?**
Facilities that comply with EPA's forthcoming Clean Air Act §111 methane standards for new and existing sources may qualify for an exemption from the waste emissions charge. The exemption specifics depend on final EPA rulemaking.
