faqs:
  - question: "Is the GBF legally binding?"
    answer: "The GBF itself is not legally binding on companies, but it's legally binding on the 196 signatory nations who must develop National Biodiversity Strategies and Action Plans (NBSAPs) to achieve its targets. These national plans are creating regulatory requirements for businesses. Additionally, GBF Target 15 specifically calls on governments to require business disclosure on biodiversity."
  - question: "What is the 30x30 target?"
    answer: "Target 3 of the GBF aims to protect and conserve at least 30% of the world's land, inland waters, coastal areas, and oceans by 2030 (up from approximately 17% of land and 8% of oceans currently). This has significant implications for extractive industries, agriculture, infrastructure, and real estate operating in or near areas that may come under protection."
  - question: "How does the GBF affect corporate strategy?"
    answer: "The GBF affects companies through multiple channels: new regulations from national implementation (NBSAPs), financial sector pressure (TNFD, sustainable finance regulations), supply chain requirements (deforestation regulations, sustainable sourcing), direct land-use restrictions (protected areas, restoration targets), and stakeholder expectations. Companies in nature-dependent sectors need to assess exposure to all 23 targets."

## What Is the Global Biodiversity Framework?

The Kunming-Montreal Global Biodiversity Framework (GBF), adopted in December 2022 at COP15 by 196 nations, is the global plan to halt and reverse biodiversity loss by 2030. It sets 23 targets organized under four goals, representing the most ambitious international biodiversity agreement ever adopted.

The GBF is to biodiversity what the Paris Agreement is to climate — it creates a global framework that will drive national regulation, financial sector requirements, and corporate strategy for the rest of the decade.

## Who It Applies To

The GBF applies to signatory nations, but its implications cascade to businesses through:
- **National regulation**: Countries must develop NBSAPs to implement GBF targets, creating domestic requirements
- **Financial regulation**: Target 14 requires integration of biodiversity into financial flows; Target 15 requires business disclosure
- **Supply chain requirements**: Targets on deforestation, pollution, and sustainable use create supply chain obligations
- **Voluntary frameworks**: TNFD, SBTN, and corporate commitments reference GBF targets

## Key Targets (Selected Business-Relevant)

**Target 1**: Plan and manage all areas to reduce biodiversity loss — implications for land-use planning and development

**Target 2**: Restore 30% of degraded ecosystems by 2030 — creates restoration requirements and opportunities

**Target 3 (30x30)**: Protect 30% of land and ocean by 2030 — expansion of protected areas affects extractive industries, agriculture, infrastructure

**Target 7**: Reduce pollution risks including pesticides by 50% by 2030 — affects agriculture, chemicals, manufacturing

**Target 8**: Minimize climate change impacts on biodiversity — links climate and biodiversity strategies

**Target 10**: Ensure sustainable management of agriculture, aquaculture, fisheries, and forestry — affects food and agriculture value chains

**Target 14**: Integrate biodiversity values into policies, regulations, and financial flows — drives sustainable finance requirements

**Target 15**: Require large businesses and financial institutions to monitor, assess, and transparently disclose risks, dependencies, and impacts on biodiversity — the corporate disclosure target

**Target 16**: Enable sustainable consumption choices and reduce food waste by 50% — affects consumer products and retail

**Target 19**: Mobilize $200 billion per year for biodiversity by 2030 — creates funding flows and green finance opportunities

## Implementation Mechanism

The GBF operates through:
1. **National Biodiversity Strategies and Action Plans (NBSAPs)**: Each country develops its plan to achieve GBF targets
2. **National targets**: Countries set their own targets aligned with global goals
3. **Monitoring framework**: Headline, component, and complementary indicators track progress
4. **Global review**: Periodic stocktakes assess collective progress
5. **Financial mechanism**: The Global Environment Facility (GEF) serves as the financial mechanism

## Implications for Business

**Regulatory risk**: As countries implement NBSAPs, expect new regulations on:
- Land use and protected areas
- Pollution and pesticide reduction
- Deforestation and ecosystem conversion
- Corporate biodiversity disclosure
- Invasive species management

**Financial risk**: Financial institutions are integrating biodiversity into:
- Investment screening and portfolio analysis
- Lending criteria and loan covenants
- Insurance underwriting
- Sustainable finance products (biodiversity bonds, nature credits)

**Operational risk**: Companies with operations or supply chains in nature-sensitive areas face:
- Restricted access to resources in expanded protected areas
- Higher costs for sustainable sourcing
- Supply chain disruption from ecosystem degradation
- Community opposition to nature-harmful activities

**Opportunity**: The GBF also creates opportunities:
- Growing markets for nature-based solutions
- Demand for biodiversity monitoring technology
- Sustainable agriculture and aquaculture premiums
- Ecosystem restoration services
- Biodiversity credits and nature finance

## Compliance Steps for Businesses

1. **Assess exposure**: Map your operations and supply chain against GBF targets to identify which affect you
2. **Monitor NBSAPs**: Track national implementation in your key markets
3. **Conduct nature assessment**: Use TNFD LEAP approach to evaluate your dependencies and impacts
4. **Set targets**: Develop nature-related targets aligned with relevant GBF targets and SBTN methodology
5. **Integrate into strategy**: Embed biodiversity into procurement, product design, site selection, and risk management
6. **Disclose**: Report on biodiversity through TNFD, CSRD E4, CDP, and your sustainability report
