## What Is the Global Biodiversity Framework?

The Kunming-Montreal Global Biodiversity Framework (GBF) was adopted on December 19, 2022, at COP15 of the UN Convention on Biological Diversity (CBD) in Montreal. It sets 4 goals for 2050 and 23 targets for 2030 aimed at halting and reversing biodiversity loss.

The GBF is often called "the Paris Agreement for nature." While it is not a regulation itself — it is an international agreement between the 196 parties to the CBD — it is being translated into national laws, policies, and regulatory requirements worldwide. For businesses, the most consequential provision is **Target 15**, which calls on governments to require large companies and financial institutions to assess and disclose their biodiversity risks, dependencies, and impacts by 2030.

## Who Does It Affect?

The GBF is an agreement between sovereign nations, not companies. However, its implementation directly affects businesses through:

- **National Biodiversity Strategies and Action Plans (NBSAPs):** Each CBD party must update its NBSAP to align with GBF targets. These plans increasingly include requirements for the private sector.
- **Target 15 (corporate disclosure):** Governments are expected to mandate or incentivize biodiversity-related disclosure by large companies and financial institutions.
- **Target 18 (subsidies reform):** Calls for the elimination or reform of $500 billion/year in subsidies harmful to biodiversity, directly affecting agriculture, fisheries, and energy sectors.
- **Target 3 (30x30):** Aims to conserve 30% of land, freshwater, and marine areas by 2030, which may restrict access to land and resources for extractive, agricultural, and real estate sectors.

Industries most affected: agriculture, food and beverage, mining, forestry, fisheries, real estate, infrastructure, tourism, and financial services.

## Key Targets Relevant to Business

**Target 3 — 30x30:** Ensure that by 2030, at least 30% of terrestrial, inland water, and coastal/marine areas are effectively conserved and managed through protected areas and other effective area-based conservation measures. This could limit operational access to ecologically sensitive areas.

**Target 7 — Reduce Pollution:** Reduce pollution risks from all sources to levels that are not harmful to biodiversity. Includes cutting excess nutrients lost to the environment by at least 50%, reducing pesticide risk by at least 50%, and eliminating plastic pollution discharge.

**Target 10 — Sustainable Agriculture/Forestry/Fisheries:** Ensure that areas under agriculture, aquaculture, fisheries, and forestry are managed sustainably, including through biodiversity-friendly practices that increase productivity and resilience.

**Target 15 — Business Disclosure:** Take legal, administrative, or policy measures to encourage and enable large and transnational companies and financial institutions to:
- Regularly monitor, assess, and disclose their risks, dependencies, and impacts on biodiversity
- Provide information to consumers to promote sustainable consumption
- Report on compliance with access and benefit-sharing regulations

This target is the primary driver of corporate biodiversity reporting requirements. It does not dictate specific frameworks but aligns closely with the TNFD recommendations and the CSRD's ESRS E4.

**Target 18 — Harmful Subsidies:** Identify and eliminate, phase out, or reform subsidies harmful to biodiversity by at least $500 billion per year by 2030. This affects agricultural subsidies, fossil fuel subsidies, and fisheries subsidies.

**Target 19 — Mobilize $200B/year:** Increase financial resources for biodiversity to at least $200 billion per year by 2030, including from all sources — public, private, domestic, and international.

## What This Means for Companies

**Short term (2024–2026):** Monitor your operating jurisdictions' NBSAP updates. Early movers are starting TNFD-aligned biodiversity assessments and integrating biodiversity into existing ESG reporting. Companies subject to the CSRD must already address biodiversity under ESRS E4 if it is material.

**Medium term (2026–2028):** Expect national legislation implementing Target 15 disclosure requirements. France is already ahead with Article 29 of its Energy-Climate Law. The EU's CSRD and Nature Restoration Law embed GBF principles. Other jurisdictions — Brazil, Colombia, UK, Japan — are developing biodiversity disclosure rules.

**By 2030:** Target 15 envisions systematic corporate biodiversity disclosure as the norm. Companies that defer action will face both regulatory and market pressure as investors, lenders, and customers increasingly demand biodiversity data.

## Compliance Steps

1. **Assess your biodiversity footprint.** Use tools like ENCORE, IBAT, and the TNFD's LEAP approach to map where your operations and supply chains interface with biodiversity-sensitive areas.
2. **Identify material dependencies and impacts.** Determine which ecosystem services your business depends on and which biodiversity impacts your operations cause.
3. **Monitor NBSAP updates.** Track the biodiversity strategies of every country where you operate or source materials. NBSAPs will define the specific regulations you'll face.
4. **Start TNFD-aligned reporting.** Even before mandatory requirements, voluntary TNFD adoption positions you for compliance and builds internal capacity.
5. **Set nature targets.** Commit to measurable, time-bound biodiversity targets — no net loss, net positive impact, or sector-specific benchmarks (e.g., zero deforestation).
6. **Engage your supply chain.** For companies dependent on agricultural or natural resource supply chains, biodiversity risk sits primarily with suppliers. Build engagement programs that mirror climate supply chain work.

## Enforcement

The GBF itself has no enforcement mechanism — it relies on national implementation. However:
- National laws transposing GBF targets will carry their own penalties
- The CSRD (for EU companies) already penalizes failure to disclose material biodiversity impacts
- The EU Nature Restoration Law (adopted 2024) sets binding restoration targets with member state enforcement
- Financial regulators are beginning to treat biodiversity as a systemic risk — the ECB and Bank of England have both published assessments

## How Sustainability Consultants Help

Consultants conduct biodiversity risk and dependency assessments, run TNFD LEAP analyses, help set science-based targets for nature (using frameworks like the Science Based Targets Network — SBTN), prepare CSRD-aligned biodiversity disclosures, and advise on supply chain biodiversity programs. Biodiversity data is less standardized than climate data, and the tools are newer — consultant expertise prevents companies from reinventing the wheel.

## Frequently Asked Questions

**Is the GBF legally binding?**
The GBF itself is a political agreement, not a treaty with direct legal enforcement. However, parties are expected to implement it through national legislation, and many are doing so.

**What is the 30x30 target?**
Target 3 of the GBF: conserve at least 30% of land and 30% of ocean by 2030 through protected areas and other conservation measures. This could restrict access to certain areas for extractive or development activities.

**How does the GBF relate to the TNFD?**
The TNFD provides the disclosure framework that companies can use to meet Target 15's call for biodiversity assessment and reporting. They are complementary — the GBF sets the political mandate, the TNFD provides the methodology.

**What is an NBSAP?**
A National Biodiversity Strategy and Action Plan — each CBD party's roadmap for implementing the GBF domestically. NBSAPs define the specific policies, regulations, and targets that will affect businesses in each jurisdiction.

**Should companies act now or wait for national laws?**
Act now. Building biodiversity assessment capability, collecting baseline data, and starting TNFD-aligned reporting takes 12–24 months. Waiting for mandatory deadlines means scrambling under pressure.
