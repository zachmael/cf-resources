## What Are the ISSB Standards?

The International Sustainability Standards Board (ISSB), established by the IFRS Foundation in November 2021, issued its first two standards in June 2023:

- **IFRS S1 (General Requirements for Disclosure of Sustainability-related Financial Information)** — a baseline standard requiring disclosure of material sustainability-related risks and opportunities
- **IFRS S2 (Climate-related Disclosures)** — a climate-specific standard covering governance, strategy, risk management, and metrics/targets

Both standards are effective for annual reporting periods beginning on or after January 1, 2024, subject to jurisdictional adoption. They build on the TCFD framework (which the ISSB formally absorbed) and incorporate elements of SASB standards and the Integrated Reporting Framework.

The ISSB standards are designed as a global baseline — a minimum floor that jurisdictions can adopt and build upon. They use **financial materiality** as their sole lens (how sustainability issues affect enterprise value), distinguishing them from the CSRD's double materiality approach.

## Who Does It Apply To?

The ISSB does not have direct enforcement power. Adoption depends on individual jurisdictions:

- **Mandatory adopters:** As of early 2026, jurisdictions including the UK, Nigeria, Kenya, Singapore, Hong Kong, Australia, Brazil, and Japan have announced plans to adopt or endorse ISSB standards in some form. Timelines vary.
- **Voluntary adopters:** Many companies are voluntarily applying ISSB standards, particularly those reporting to global investors or operating across multiple jurisdictions.
- **IOSCO endorsement:** The International Organization of Securities Commissions (IOSCO) endorsed the ISSB standards in July 2023, calling on its 130+ member regulators to consider adoption.

The standards apply to all entities that provide general-purpose financial reports, with proportionality provisions for smaller entities.

## Key Requirements

**IFRS S1 — General Requirements:**
- Disclose material information about sustainability-related risks and opportunities that could reasonably be expected to affect the entity's cash flows, access to finance, or cost of capital over the short, medium, and long term.
- Structured around the same four pillars as TCFD: governance, strategy, risk management, and metrics/targets.
- Requires disclosure of the current and anticipated financial effects of sustainability-related risks and opportunities.
- Provides transition reliefs: in the first year of application, entities may focus on climate-related risks and opportunities only (rather than all sustainability topics).

**IFRS S2 — Climate:**
- Requires disclosure of Scope 1, Scope 2, and Scope 3 GHG emissions measured in accordance with the GHG Protocol.
- Scope 3 is mandatory but comes with a one-year grace period in the first reporting year.
- Requires disclosure of climate-related targets, including whether they are science-based.
- Requires climate scenario analysis — at minimum, a scenario consistent with the latest international agreement on climate change (i.e., the Paris Agreement).
- Industry-specific metrics are drawn from SASB standards, with 68 industry-specific disclosure topics.

**Connected Disclosures:** ISSB standards require that sustainability disclosures be connected to financial statements — published at the same time, covering the same reporting period, and cross-referenced where relevant.

## Timeline

| Milestone | Date |
|-----------|------|
| ISSB established | November 2021 |
| IFRS S1 and S2 issued | June 26, 2023 |
| Standards effective date | Annual periods from January 1, 2024 |
| IOSCO endorsement | July 2023 |
| UK adoption (expected) | FY 2026 onward |
| Australia adoption (expected) | FY 2024–2027 (phased) |
| Japan/Brazil adoption | 2025–2027 (varies) |

## Compliance Steps

1. **Check your jurisdiction.** Determine whether your national regulator has adopted ISSB standards, is planning to, or has set a voluntary pathway.
2. **Map existing disclosures.** If you already report under TCFD, CDP, or SASB, you have a head start — ISSB standards incorporate elements of all three.
3. **Conduct a financial materiality assessment.** Identify sustainability-related risks and opportunities that could affect enterprise value. This is narrower than double materiality but still requires structured analysis.
4. **Build Scope 3 capability.** IFRS S2 requires Scope 3 emissions. Use the one-year transition relief strategically — start collecting data in year one even if you don't disclose until year two.
5. **Run scenario analysis.** IFRS S2 requires at least one Paris-aligned scenario. Build quantitative models or engage consultants with climate modeling expertise.
6. **Align timing with financial reports.** ISSB standards require sustainability disclosures to be published with financial statements, not on a separate timeline. Coordinate with your finance team and auditors.

## Enforcement

Enforcement depends entirely on jurisdictional adoption. Where adopted as mandatory (e.g., via securities regulation), standard penalties for non-compliance with disclosure requirements apply — typically financial penalties and potential delisting consequences. Where voluntary, market pressure from investors using the standards as a benchmark provides the enforcement mechanism.

## How Sustainability Consultants Help

Consultants perform materiality assessments aligned to the ISSB's financial materiality lens, build GHG inventories (particularly Scope 3), conduct scenario analyses, map SASB industry-specific metrics, and prepare disclosures formatted for integration with financial reporting. For companies operating across jurisdictions with different adoption timelines, consultants help build a single disclosure platform that satisfies multiple regimes.

## Frequently Asked Questions

**How do ISSB standards differ from the CSRD?**
The ISSB uses financial materiality only (how sustainability affects enterprise value). The CSRD uses double materiality (adding how the company affects people and the environment). The ISSB is a global baseline; the CSRD is EU-specific and more prescriptive.

**Is Scope 3 required under IFRS S2?**
Yes, but with a one-year transition relief. In the first reporting year, companies may omit Scope 3 while building data collection systems.

**Do I need to report under both ISSB and CSRD?**
If you are subject to CSRD and operate in a jurisdiction that adopts ISSB standards, you may need both. The EU has published interoperability guidance showing where ESRS and ISSB standards overlap.

**What are SASB industry metrics?**
IFRS S2 incorporates 68 industry-specific disclosure topics from the SASB Standards, now maintained by the ISSB. These provide granular, industry-relevant metrics (e.g., fleet fuel efficiency for airlines, water intensity for mining).

**When will ISSB standards cover topics beyond climate?**
The ISSB has signaled that biodiversity and human capital will be future priorities, but no additional standards have been issued as of early 2026. IFRS S1 already requires disclosure of non-climate sustainability risks if they are financially material.
