## What Is the CSDDD?

The Corporate Sustainability Due Diligence Directive (CSDDD), also referred to as CS3D, was adopted by the European Council on May 24, 2024, and published in the Official Journal on July 5, 2024. It creates a mandatory due diligence framework requiring large companies to identify, prevent, mitigate, and account for human rights and environmental adverse impacts in their own operations, those of their subsidiaries, and their chains of activities (upstream and downstream business partners).

The CSDDD goes beyond existing national laws like Germany's LkSG in several important ways: it covers the full value chain (not just direct suppliers), introduces **civil liability** for failure to conduct adequate due diligence, and requires companies to adopt **climate transition plans** aligned with the Paris Agreement's 1.5°C target.

Member states must transpose the directive into national law by **July 26, 2026**.

## Who Does It Apply To?

The CSDDD applies in phases based on company size:

**EU companies:**
- **From July 26, 2027:** Companies with 5,000+ employees and €1.5B+ net worldwide turnover
- **From July 26, 2028:** Companies with 3,000+ employees and €900M+ net worldwide turnover
- **From July 26, 2029:** Companies with 1,000+ employees and €450M+ net worldwide turnover

**Non-EU companies:**
- Same phase-in schedule, based on **EU-generated net turnover** at the same thresholds (€1.5B / €900M / €450M)
- Non-EU companies must designate an authorized representative in the EU

The original Commission proposal included financial sector coverage, but the final text largely excluded financial institutions' downstream activities, covering only their upstream (procurement) activities.

## Key Requirements

**Due Diligence Obligations:**
1. **Integrate due diligence into policies and management systems** — adopt a due diligence policy, regularly updated, that describes the company's approach, code of conduct, and implementation processes
2. **Identify and assess adverse impacts** — map your chain of activities to identify actual and potential adverse human rights and environmental impacts
3. **Prevent and mitigate potential impacts** — develop and implement a prevention action plan with reasonable measures, including contractual assurances, investment, and collaboration
4. **Bring actual impacts to an end** — take corrective action when adverse impacts materialize, including remediation
5. **Establish a complaints mechanism** — provide a procedure for affected persons, trade unions, and civil society to raise concerns
6. **Monitor effectiveness** — periodically assess the adequacy of your due diligence measures
7. **Communicate publicly** — publish an annual statement on due diligence (or meet equivalent CSRD reporting obligations)

**Climate Transition Plan:** Companies must adopt and implement a transition plan to ensure their business model and strategy are compatible with the 1.5°C warming limit of the Paris Agreement. The plan must include time-bound targets for 2030 and in five-year steps to 2050, a description of decarbonization levers, an explanation of the role of offsets (if used), and investment and funding plans. Directors must oversee implementation.

**Civil Liability:** Member states must ensure that companies are liable for damages caused to natural or legal persons when they intentionally or negligently fail to comply with their due diligence obligations and that failure results in damage. This is a significant departure from the German LkSG, which does not include civil liability.

**Chain of Activities:** The CSDDD covers upstream business partners (suppliers at all tiers) and downstream partners (distributors, transporters, and storage providers, but not end consumers or disposal/recycling). This is narrower than the Commission's original "value chain" proposal but broader than the LkSG's direct-supplier focus.

## Timeline

| Milestone | Date |
|-----------|------|
| Directive published in Official Journal | July 5, 2024 |
| Member state transposition deadline | July 26, 2026 |
| Phase 1: 5,000+ employees, €1.5B+ turnover | July 26, 2027 |
| Phase 2: 3,000+ employees, €900M+ turnover | July 26, 2028 |
| Phase 3: 1,000+ employees, €450M+ turnover | July 26, 2029 |

## Compliance Steps

1. **Assess applicability.** Calculate employee count and net turnover (worldwide for EU companies; EU-generated for non-EU companies) against the phased thresholds.
2. **Map your chain of activities.** Identify upstream suppliers (all tiers) and downstream partners. Prioritize mapping based on sector, geography, and known risk indicators.
3. **Conduct impact assessment.** Identify actual and potential adverse impacts on human rights (using the international instruments referenced in the directive's annex) and environmental matters (including climate, biodiversity, and pollution).
4. **Develop a prevention action plan.** For each identified potential impact, design proportionate prevention measures — contractual assurances, investment support, verified improvement programs, and business relationship restructuring where necessary.
5. **Establish a complaints mechanism.** Ensure it is accessible to affected stakeholders, workers, trade unions, and civil society organizations. Process complaints within a reasonable timeframe.
6. **Adopt a climate transition plan.** Set science-based targets, identify decarbonization pathways, allocate investment, and integrate the plan into corporate strategy.
7. **Coordinate with existing frameworks.** If you already comply with the German LkSG, French Duty of Vigilance, or other national laws, map those programs to CSDDD requirements to identify gaps (particularly civil liability and the climate transition plan).

## Penalties and Enforcement

Member states must designate supervisory authorities with powers to:
- Conduct investigations
- Order companies to cease infringements
- Impose **fines of up to 5% of net worldwide turnover**

The civil liability provision allows affected persons to seek damages in EU courts. Trade unions and NGOs may bring representative actions on behalf of affected individuals, subject to member state procedural rules. The statute of limitations for civil claims is at least five years.

## How Sustainability Consultants Help

Consultants design and implement due diligence management systems, conduct supply chain mapping and risk assessment, develop prevention action plans, draft climate transition plans with credible science-based targets, train procurement and operations teams, and prepare for civil liability exposure. The CSDDD's scope — covering the full upstream and downstream chain of activities — makes this a fundamentally larger undertaking than compliance with the German LkSG alone.

## Frequently Asked Questions

**How does the CSDDD differ from the German LkSG?**
The CSDDD covers the full chain of activities (not just direct suppliers), includes civil liability (the LkSG does not), requires a climate transition plan, and uses turnover-based thresholds instead of employee-only thresholds.

**Does the CSDDD apply to non-EU companies?**
Yes. Non-EU companies generating sufficient net turnover in the EU (€450M+ in the final phase) are in scope and must designate an EU authorized representative.

**What does civil liability mean in practice?**
If your company negligently fails to conduct adequate due diligence and that failure causes damage to a person (e.g., forced labor in the supply chain, environmental contamination), the affected person can sue for compensation in EU courts.

**Is the financial sector covered?**
Partially. Financial institutions must conduct due diligence on their upstream (procurement) activities. Their downstream lending and investment activities were largely excluded from the final text, though the Commission will review this.

**Do I need a climate transition plan even if I already have science-based targets?**
Yes. The CSDDD requires a formal transition plan — not just targets. The plan must include time-bound milestones, decarbonization levers, investment allocation, and explanation of offset use. Existing SBTi-validated targets are a strong foundation but may not fully satisfy the directive's specific requirements.
