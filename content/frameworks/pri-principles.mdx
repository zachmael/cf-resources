faqs:
  - question: "How many investors have signed PRI?"
    answer: "Over 5,300 signatories representing approximately $120 trillion in assets under management, making PRI the dominant responsible investment framework globally."
  - question: "What are the six Principles for Responsible Investment?"
    answer: "1) Incorporate ESG into investment analysis and decisions. 2) Be active owners incorporating ESG into ownership policies. 3) Seek appropriate ESG disclosures from investee entities. 4) Promote adoption of the Principles. 5) Work together to enhance implementation. 6) Report on activities and progress."
  - question: "Is PRI the same as ESG investing?"
    answer: "PRI provides the framework for ESG integration in investment, but ESG investing encompasses a broader range of approaches — exclusion, best-in-class, integration, thematic, and impact investing. PRI encourages integration as a minimum, with advanced implementation moving toward active ownership and impact."

## What It Is

The Principles for Responsible Investment (PRI) is a United Nations-supported international network of investors working to implement six principles for incorporating environmental, social, and governance factors into investment practice. Launched in 2006 by then-UN Secretary-General Kofi Annan, PRI has grown from 100 founding signatories to over 5,300 organizations representing approximately $120 trillion in assets under management.

PRI operates on the premise that ESG factors can affect the performance of investment portfolios and that incorporating them into investment analysis and decision-making is consistent with investors' fiduciary duties. The six principles are aspirational — signatories commit to working toward their implementation over time rather than achieving immediate full compliance.

PRI's influence extends beyond its signatory base. Through annual reporting and assessment, collaborative engagement initiatives (like Climate Action 100+), policy advocacy, and research, PRI shapes how the global investment industry approaches sustainability.

## Who Uses It

- **Asset managers** — the majority of large global asset managers are PRI signatories
- **Asset owners** — pension funds, sovereign wealth funds, insurance companies, and endowments
- **Service providers** — investment consultants, research providers, and data firms
- **Companies** indirectly — PRI-signatory investors use their collective influence to engage companies on ESG performance

## Key Requirements

The six Principles commit signatories to:

1. **Incorporate ESG issues into investment analysis and decision-making processes** — integrating ESG data into valuation models, portfolio construction, and risk assessment
2. **Be active owners and incorporate ESG into ownership policies and practices** — voting proxies on ESG issues, engaging with companies on ESG performance, filing shareholder resolutions
3. **Seek appropriate disclosure on ESG issues by investee entities** — requesting TCFD-aligned climate disclosure, supporting CDP, encouraging sustainability reporting
4. **Promote acceptance and implementation of the Principles within the investment industry** — advocating for ESG integration with peers, service providers, and regulators
5. **Work together to enhance effectiveness in implementing the Principles** — participating in collaborative engagement initiatives, sharing best practices
6. **Report on activities and progress toward implementing the Principles** — annual reporting through PRI's Reporting Framework, which is publicly available

PRI's annual Reporting and Assessment framework evaluates signatories across modules covering investment and stewardship policy, direct and indirect ESG integration, climate change, and asset-class-specific implementation.

## How to Implement

**Phase 1: Commitment (1-2 months)**
Sign the Principles. Designate a responsible investment lead. Assess current ESG integration across investment processes and asset classes.

**Phase 2: Policy Development (2-4 months)**
Develop or update responsible investment policy. Define ESG integration approach by asset class. Establish proxy voting guidelines incorporating ESG factors. Develop engagement policy and priorities.

**Phase 3: Integration (3-12 months)**
Embed ESG data into investment analysis processes. Train portfolio managers and analysts on ESG integration. Select ESG data providers and tools. Develop ESG scoring or assessment methodologies.

**Phase 4: Active Ownership (ongoing)**
Implement proxy voting on ESG resolutions. Engage directly with portfolio companies on material ESG issues. Participate in collaborative engagement initiatives (Climate Action 100+, Nature Action 100).

**Phase 5: Reporting (annual)**
Complete PRI's annual reporting framework. Publish responsible investment report. Disclose proxy voting record.

## Relationship to Other Frameworks

**TCFD**: PRI was instrumental in driving TCFD adoption by investors and has integrated TCFD reporting into its Reporting Framework. PRI signatories are expected to support TCFD disclosure from investee companies.

**CDP**: PRI collaborates with CDP and encourages signatories to use CDP data for ESG analysis and to request CDP disclosure from portfolio companies.

**SBTi**: PRI supports investor engagement with companies on science-based targets. The Net Zero Asset Managers initiative, closely linked to PRI, commits signatories to SBTi-aligned portfolio decarbonization.

**PSI**: PRI covers the investment side of financial institutions while PSI covers underwriting. Many insurers are dual signatories.

**SDGs**: PRI increasingly frames responsible investment in terms of SDG outcomes and real-world impact, moving beyond risk-return optimization.

## Why It Matters

PRI matters because it represents the commitment of $120 trillion in institutional capital to ESG integration. This concentration of investor influence shapes corporate behavior — companies seeking capital access, favorable cost of capital, and constructive shareholder relationships must respond to the ESG expectations that PRI signatories collectively express.

PRI's collaborative engagement initiatives demonstrate the power of coordinated investor action. Climate Action 100+, facilitated partly through PRI infrastructure, engages the world's largest corporate emitters on climate strategy and disclosure. Individual investors lack the leverage to change corporate behavior; organized investor coalitions can.

The framework's evolution reflects the broader maturation of responsible investment — from exclusion and negative screening toward integration, active ownership, and increasingly, real-world impact measurement. As regulatory requirements for investor climate disclosure grow (UK SDR, EU SFDR), PRI's reporting framework provides the infrastructure for systematic accountability.
