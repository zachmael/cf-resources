faqs:
  - question: "What types of projects do the Equator Principles cover?"
    answer: "EP applies to project finance over $10M, project-related corporate loans over $50M, bridge loans, and project-related refinancing and acquisition financing. Most commonly applied to infrastructure, energy, mining, oil and gas, and industrial projects."
  - question: "How do the Equator Principles relate to IFC Performance Standards?"
    answer: "EP requires compliance with IFC Performance Standards on Environmental and Social Sustainability for projects in non-designated countries. These standards cover environmental assessment, labor, pollution, community health, land acquisition, biodiversity, Indigenous peoples, and cultural heritage."
  - question: "Are the Equator Principles legally binding?"
    answer: "EP are a voluntary commitment adopted by financial institutions, but once adopted they create binding internal procedures. Projects that fail to meet EP requirements cannot receive financing from EP-adopting banks, creating significant market discipline."

## What It Is

The Equator Principles (EP) are a risk management framework adopted by financial institutions to identify, assess, and manage environmental and social risks in project finance transactions. First established in 2003 and currently in their fourth iteration (EP4, effective 2020), the Equator Principles are based on the IFC Performance Standards and the World Bank Group Environmental, Health, and Safety Guidelines.

EP4 applies to four financial products: project finance advisory services, project finance with total capital costs of $10 million or more, project-related corporate loans of $50 million or more, and bridge loans. Projects are categorized by potential environmental and social impact: Category A (significant potential adverse impacts), Category B (limited potential adverse impacts), and Category C (minimal or no impacts).

For Category A and B projects, the Principles require comprehensive environmental and social impact assessment, compliance with applicable laws, adherence to IFC Performance Standards (for non-designated countries), stakeholder engagement, grievance mechanisms, independent review, and ongoing monitoring and reporting.

## Who Uses It

- **Over 140 financial institutions** across 40 countries, collectively providing the vast majority of global project finance
- **Project developers** seeking financing from EP-adopting banks — who must meet EP requirements to access capital
- **Environmental and social consultants** conducting assessments required by EP
- **Communities and civil society organizations** using EP as an accountability framework for financed projects

## Key Requirements

1. **Environmental and Social Assessment** for Category A and B projects — comprehensive analysis of environmental and social impacts, risks, and mitigation measures
2. **Applicable Standards** — compliance with host country law plus IFC Performance Standards and EHS Guidelines for projects in non-designated countries
3. **Environmental and Social Management System** — documented ESMS with clear roles, monitoring procedures, and corrective action processes
4. **Stakeholder Engagement** — structured and culturally appropriate consultation with affected communities, with Free Prior and Informed Consent (FPIC) required for projects affecting Indigenous Peoples
5. **Grievance Mechanism** — accessible process for affected communities to raise concerns and receive responses
6. **Independent Review** — independent environmental and social consultant review for Category A and higher-risk Category B projects
7. **Covenants** — compliance with EP requirements included in financing documentation, with remedies for non-compliance
8. **Monitoring and Reporting** — ongoing monitoring of compliance throughout the project lifecycle
9. **Climate Change Risk Assessment** — EP4 added requirements for quantifying Scope 1 and Scope 2 emissions for projects exceeding 100,000 tCO2e/year and alternatives analysis for high-emitting projects

## How to Implement

For financial institutions adopting EP:
- Develop EP implementation procedures and policies
- Train project finance teams on categorization and assessment requirements
- Establish relationships with qualified environmental and social consultants
- Integrate EP requirements into credit approval processes
- Develop monitoring and reporting systems

For project developers seeking EP-compliant financing:
- Conduct environmental and social impact assessment early in project development
- Design the project to comply with IFC Performance Standards
- Establish stakeholder engagement processes and grievance mechanisms
- Plan for ongoing environmental and social monitoring
- Budget for independent review and compliance monitoring

## Relationship to Other Frameworks

**IFC Performance Standards**: EP requires compliance with IFC PS for projects in non-designated countries. The eight Performance Standards cover assessment, labor, pollution, community health, land acquisition, biodiversity, Indigenous Peoples, and cultural heritage.

**TCFD**: EP4 incorporates climate risk assessment requirements aligned with TCFD, including emissions quantification and alternatives analysis.

**UN Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights**: EP's human rights due diligence requirements align with the UNGPs framework.

**EU Taxonomy**: EP-compliant projects often align with EU Taxonomy environmental objectives, facilitating green bond issuance.

## Why It Matters

The Equator Principles demonstrate how voluntary standards adopted by financial institutions can create market-wide environmental and social discipline. Because EP-adopting banks cover the majority of global project finance, projects that fail to meet EP requirements effectively cannot access mainstream project finance — creating a powerful incentive for environmental and social performance regardless of local regulatory standards.

For project developers, EP compliance is a practical necessity for accessing capital. For financial institutions, EP adoption manages reputational, legal, and credit risk while providing a consistent framework for environmental and social due diligence across diverse jurisdictions and project types.
