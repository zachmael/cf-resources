faqs:
  - question: "Are GRI Standards mandatory?"
    answer: "GRI Standards are voluntary globally, but they form the basis for mandatory reporting in several jurisdictions. The EU's ESRS standards under CSRD were developed in collaboration with GRI and share significant alignment. Several countries (South Africa, Brazil, India) reference or require GRI-based reporting."
  - question: "What is the difference between GRI and SASB?"
    answer: "GRI focuses on impact materiality — how the organization affects people and the environment. SASB focuses on financial materiality — how sustainability issues affect enterprise value. They serve different but complementary purposes and audiences."
  - question: "How long does it take to produce a first GRI report?"
    answer: "A first GRI-aligned sustainability report typically takes 6-12 months to produce, depending on existing data availability. The materiality assessment alone takes 2-4 months. Organizations with existing ESG data can move faster."
  - question: "What changed in the 2021 GRI Standards revision?"
    answer: "The 2021 revision strengthened the materiality concept (requiring assessment of actual and potential impacts, not just stakeholder interest), improved human rights due diligence alignment, and restructured the universal standards for clearer application."
  - question: "Can small companies use GRI?"
    answer: "Yes. GRI offers a 'with reference to' option that allows organizations to use selected standards without claiming full compliance. This provides a structured starting point that can evolve toward comprehensive reporting over time."

## What It Is

The Global Reporting Initiative (GRI) Standards are the most widely used framework for sustainability reporting worldwide. First published in 2000 and significantly revised in 2021, GRI provides a comprehensive set of disclosure standards covering economic, environmental, and social impacts. Over 10,000 organizations in more than 100 countries report using GRI Standards, making it the de facto global language of sustainability disclosure.

GRI operates on the principle of **impact materiality** — the idea that organizations should report on their most significant impacts on the economy, environment, and people, including impacts on human rights. This distinguishes GRI from financially-oriented frameworks like ISSB/SASB, which focus on how sustainability issues affect enterprise value (financial materiality). GRI's perspective is outward-looking: what is the organization doing to the world?

The Standards are organized into three categories:

**Universal Standards (GRI 1, 2, 3)** apply to all organizations. GRI 1 establishes the foundational requirements for reporting in accordance with the Standards. GRI 2 covers general disclosures about the organization — governance, strategy, policies, stakeholder engagement. GRI 3 describes how to determine material topics through a structured materiality assessment process.

**Sector Standards** provide sector-specific guidance on likely material topics and relevant disclosures. GRI is progressively developing sector standards — oil and gas (GRI 11), coal (GRI 12), and agriculture/aquaculture/fishing (GRI 13) are published, with mining, textiles, and financial services in development.

**Topic Standards (GRI 200, 300, 400 series)** provide specific disclosure requirements for individual topics. Environmental topics include emissions (GRI 305), water (GRI 303), waste (GRI 306), and biodiversity (GRI 304). Social topics include employment (GRI 401), occupational health and safety (GRI 403), diversity (GRI 405), and child labor (GRI 408). Economic topics include anti-corruption (GRI 205) and tax (GRI 207).

## Who Uses It

GRI Standards are used across every sector and geography, but adoption is particularly strong in:

- **European companies** preparing for or already subject to CSRD, since ESRS standards are closely aligned with GRI
- **Companies in emerging markets** where GRI is often the default reporting framework (South Africa, Brazil, India, Southeast Asia)
- **Organizations seeking broad stakeholder communication** — GRI's impact-oriented approach resonates with NGOs, communities, employees, and governments
- **Companies subject to stock exchange ESG reporting requirements** — many exchanges (Johannesburg, São Paulo, Singapore, Hong Kong) reference GRI in their listing rules
- **Multinational corporations** needing a single framework that works across jurisdictions
- **Public sector organizations** and state-owned enterprises reporting on sustainability performance

## Key Requirements and Principles

Reporting "in accordance with" GRI Standards requires:

1. **Materiality assessment** following GRI 3 — identifying the organization's most significant impacts on the economy, environment, and people through a structured process involving stakeholder engagement and expert input
2. **Disclosure on all material topics** using the relevant Topic Standards, including management approach (how the topic is managed) and specific metrics
3. **Complete reporting on Universal Standards** — organizational profile, governance, strategy, policies, and stakeholder engagement
4. **Applying the reporting principles** — accuracy, balance, clarity, comparability, completeness, sustainability context, timeliness, and verifiability
5. **GRI Content Index** — a table mapping every reported disclosure to the relevant GRI Standard and location in the report

Organizations not ready for full compliance can report "with reference to" GRI Standards, disclosing on selected topics without claiming full accordance.

## How to Implement

**Phase 1: Preparation (2-3 months)**
Establish a reporting team with cross-functional representation. Define the reporting scope (entities, topics, time period). Review GRI Standards structure and identify applicable sector standards. Engage leadership on the reporting commitment.

**Phase 2: Materiality Assessment (2-4 months)**
Conduct a materiality assessment per GRI 3. Identify actual and potential impacts — positive and negative — across the value chain. Engage stakeholders (investors, employees, communities, customers, civil society). Prioritize material topics based on severity and likelihood of impacts.

**Phase 3: Data Collection (2-4 months)**
For each material topic, collect data against the relevant Topic Standard disclosures. Establish data ownership, collection processes, and quality controls. Address data gaps — this is typically the most time-consuming phase for first-time reporters.

**Phase 4: Report Development (2-3 months)**
Draft disclosures for each material topic. Develop the management approach narrative. Create the GRI Content Index. Design the report for readability and stakeholder accessibility.

**Phase 5: Review and Publication**
Internal review by legal, communications, and subject matter experts. Consider external assurance (increasingly expected by stakeholders). Publish and communicate to key audiences.

## Relationship to Other Frameworks

GRI and ESRS share the closest alignment — EFRAG developed ESRS in collaboration with GRI, and the two organizations published an interoperability guide. Companies already reporting under GRI have a significant head start on CSRD compliance.

GRI and ISSB/SASB are complementary rather than competing. GRI addresses impact materiality while ISSB addresses financial materiality. Together, they cover the "double materiality" required by CSRD. Many companies report under both.

GRI disclosures overlap substantially with CDP questionnaire requirements. Companies with strong GRI reports can often leverage the same data for CDP disclosure.

GRI's Topic Standards on emissions (GRI 305) reference the GHG Protocol for measurement methodology, and GRI 305 disclosures align closely with TCFD Metrics & Targets recommendations.

## Why It Matters

GRI matters because it provides the most comprehensive framework for understanding and communicating an organization's sustainability impacts. While financial-materiality frameworks like ISSB are essential for investor communication, GRI's impact-materiality lens captures the information that governments, communities, employees, and civil society need to assess whether organizations are operating responsibly.

With CSRD bringing mandatory impact-based reporting to approximately 50,000 companies in the EU (and many non-EU companies with significant EU operations), GRI's principles and structure are becoming regulatory requirements — not just voluntary best practice. Organizations that build GRI reporting capability today are building the infrastructure they'll need for regulatory compliance tomorrow.

For organizations beginning their reporting journey, GRI provides the most broadly recognized starting point. Its flexibility (the "with reference to" option), comprehensive topic coverage, and global acceptance make it the foundation on which other framework-specific disclosures can be built.
