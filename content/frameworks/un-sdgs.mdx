faqs:
  - question: "Are the SDGs legally binding?"
    answer: "No. The SDGs are a voluntary framework adopted by all 193 UN member states in 2015. However, they increasingly inform national legislation and corporate reporting frameworks. CSRD references the SDGs, and many investors assess companies' SDG alignment."
  - question: "How do companies avoid SDG-washing?"
    answer: "By conducting rigorous materiality assessments to identify genuinely relevant goals, setting measurable targets linked to specific SDG targets (not just goals), reporting on negative impacts alongside positive contributions, and using recognized frameworks like GRI for measurement."
  - question: "Which SDGs are most relevant for corporate sustainability?"
    answer: "This varies by industry, but SDG 13 (Climate Action), SDG 12 (Responsible Consumption and Production), SDG 8 (Decent Work and Economic Growth), SDG 7 (Affordable and Clean Energy), and SDG 6 (Clean Water and Sanitation) are most commonly material for businesses."

## What It Is

The United Nations Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) are 17 interconnected global goals adopted by all UN member states in September 2015 as part of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development. The goals provide a shared blueprint for peace and prosperity for people and planet, addressing challenges including poverty, inequality, climate change, environmental degradation, and justice.

The 17 goals encompass 169 specific targets and 231 unique indicators for measuring progress. They were designed as an integrated framework — recognizing that action in one area affects outcomes in others.

For businesses, the SDGs serve three primary functions: as a **strategic framework** for identifying sustainability priorities and opportunities, as a **communication tool** for articulating sustainability contributions to stakeholders, and as a **reporting lens** that connects corporate actions to global outcomes.

The SDGs are not a reporting standard — they don't specify how to measure or disclose performance. Rather, they provide the outcome framework that reporting standards (GRI, ISSB, CDP) help companies track and communicate contributions toward.

The goals span environmental (SDGs 6, 7, 12, 13, 14, 15), social (SDGs 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 8, 10, 16), and economic (SDGs 8, 9, 11, 17) dimensions, with significant interconnections across all three.

## Who Uses It

- **National governments** developing national sustainable development strategies and Voluntary National Reviews
- **Companies** aligning sustainability strategy with global priorities and communicating impact to stakeholders
- **Investors** using SDG alignment as a framework for impact investing and portfolio assessment
- **Development finance institutions** and multilateral banks structuring funding around SDG outcomes
- **Cities and municipalities** organizing local sustainability initiatives
- **Universities and research institutions** framing sustainability research agendas
- **NGOs and civil society** using SDGs as advocacy and accountability frameworks

## Key Goals and Corporate Relevance

The 17 goals, with their most common corporate applications:

- **SDG 1-5** (No Poverty, Zero Hunger, Good Health, Quality Education, Gender Equality): Social impact, workforce development, diversity and inclusion, supply chain labor standards
- **SDG 6** (Clean Water): Water stewardship, wastewater management, water-stressed operations
- **SDG 7** (Affordable and Clean Energy): Renewable energy procurement, energy efficiency, energy access
- **SDG 8** (Decent Work and Economic Growth): Labor practices, living wages, economic contribution
- **SDG 9** (Industry, Innovation, Infrastructure): Sustainable infrastructure, R&D, inclusive industrialization
- **SDG 10** (Reduced Inequalities): Pay equity, inclusive business practices, community investment
- **SDG 11** (Sustainable Cities): Urban development, resilient infrastructure, accessible transportation
- **SDG 12** (Responsible Consumption and Production): Circular economy, waste reduction, sustainable sourcing
- **SDG 13** (Climate Action): Emissions reduction, climate resilience, adaptation
- **SDG 14** (Life Below Water): Ocean conservation, marine pollution, sustainable fisheries
- **SDG 15** (Life on Land): Biodiversity, deforestation, ecosystem restoration
- **SDG 16** (Peace, Justice, Institutions): Anti-corruption, human rights, governance
- **SDG 17** (Partnerships): Multi-stakeholder collaboration, technology transfer

## How to Implement

**Phase 1: Understand the Goals (1-2 weeks)**
Go beyond the 17 goal headlines to the 169 targets. Identify which targets are relevant to your industry, value chain, and geographic context. Use the SDG Compass (GRI, UNGC, WBCSD) as a guide.

**Phase 2: Prioritize (1-2 months)**
Conduct a materiality assessment to identify where your organization has the most significant positive and negative impacts relative to the SDGs. Avoid selecting goals based on marketing appeal — focus on where you have genuine impact and influence.

**Phase 3: Set Targets (1-2 months)**
For priority SDGs, set measurable targets connected to specific SDG targets. Use recognized methodologies where available — SBTi for SDG 13, AWS for SDG 6, etc.

**Phase 4: Integrate and Report (ongoing)**
Embed SDG priorities into business strategy, not just CSR programs. Report contributions and impacts using recognized frameworks (GRI provides SDG mapping for all its standards). Be transparent about negative impacts, not just positive contributions.

## Relationship to Other Frameworks

**GRI**: GRI provides detailed guidance on how its standards map to specific SDG targets, making GRI the most direct pathway from corporate reporting to SDG contribution measurement.

**ISSB/SASB**: While ISSB focuses on financial materiality rather than SDG outcomes, many SASB metrics correspond to SDG-relevant topics.

**CDP**: CDP maps its questionnaire responses to relevant SDGs, and CDP data can demonstrate corporate contributions to climate (SDG 13), water (SDG 6), and forest (SDG 15) goals.

**Impact investing frameworks**: The Impact Management Platform and IRIS+ metrics system are explicitly designed to measure investment contributions to SDGs.

## Why It Matters

The SDGs matter because they represent the most comprehensive global consensus on what sustainable development looks like. For businesses, they provide a framework for connecting corporate sustainability efforts to the outcomes that governments, investors, employees, and communities care about.

With the 2030 deadline approaching and most goals significantly off-track, the pressure on businesses to demonstrate genuine SDG contributions is intensifying. The era of superficial SDG alignment — logos on sustainability reports without measurable targets — is ending. Companies that can demonstrate rigorous, measurable contributions to specific SDG targets through credible reporting frameworks will be distinguished from those engaged in SDG-washing.
