faqs:
  - question: "Is TCFD still relevant now that it has been disbanded?"
    answer: "Yes. TCFD's recommendations are fully incorporated into ISSB IFRS S2, ESRS, and numerous jurisdictional regulations. The framework lives on as the structural backbone of mandatory climate disclosure worldwide. The FSB transferred monitoring responsibilities to the IFRS Foundation."
  - question: "What are the four pillars of TCFD?"
    answer: "Governance (board and management oversight of climate risks), Strategy (actual and potential impacts of climate risks and opportunities), Risk Management (processes for identifying, assessing, and managing climate risks), and Metrics & Targets (metrics and targets used to assess and manage climate risks)."
  - question: "What is climate scenario analysis under TCFD?"
    answer: "Scenario analysis assesses organizational resilience under different climate futures — typically a 1.5°C/2°C transition scenario and a higher-warming physical risk scenario. It's not a prediction but a stress test of strategy against plausible climate outcomes."

## What It Is

The Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures (TCFD) was established by the Financial Stability Board in 2015, chaired by Michael Bloomberg and Mark Carney, and published its final recommendations in June 2017. The recommendations created a structured framework for companies to disclose climate-related financial risks and opportunities to investors, lenders, and insurance underwriters.

TCFD's four-pillar structure — Governance, Strategy, Risk Management, and Metrics & Targets — became the universal architecture for climate disclosure, adopted by regulators, standard-setters, and companies worldwide. The task force was formally disbanded in October 2023, with its monitoring responsibilities transferred to the IFRS Foundation (which houses ISSB), because the recommendations had been so thoroughly absorbed into mandatory standards that a separate body was no longer necessary.

TCFD's core innovation was framing climate as a **financial risk** rather than purely an environmental concern. By organizing disclosure around the same governance, strategy, and risk management structures that investors already use to evaluate companies, TCFD made climate risk legible to financial markets in a way that previous sustainability reporting frameworks had not.

The recommendations cover both **physical risks** (acute events like hurricanes and chronic changes like sea-level rise) and **transition risks** (policy changes, technology disruption, market shifts, and reputational effects associated with the shift to a lower-carbon economy). They also require disclosure of **climate-related opportunities** — new markets, resource efficiencies, energy sources, and products/services enabled by the transition.

## Who Uses It

At its peak, over 4,000 organizations across 100 countries expressed support for TCFD. Adoption was particularly strong among:

- **Financial institutions** — banks, insurers, and asset managers where climate risk has direct implications for portfolio value and risk management
- **Companies subject to mandatory TCFD-aligned regulations** — UK (all premium-listed companies since 2021), New Zealand, Japan, Singapore, Hong Kong, Switzerland, and Brazil
- **Companies reporting to CDP** — CDP's questionnaire is structured around TCFD's four pillars
- **Companies with institutional investor bases** — Climate Action 100+ and other investor coalitions used TCFD as the benchmark for assessing corporate climate governance
- **CSRD-reporting companies** — ESRS climate disclosures (ESRS E1) follow the TCFD structure

## Key Requirements

**Governance:** Describe board oversight of climate-related risks and opportunities. Describe management's role in assessing and managing climate-related risks.

**Strategy:** Describe climate-related risks and opportunities identified over the short, medium, and long term. Describe the impact on the organization's businesses, strategy, and financial planning. Describe the resilience of strategy under different climate scenarios, including a 2°C or lower scenario.

**Risk Management:** Describe processes for identifying and assessing climate-related risks. Describe processes for managing climate-related risks. Describe how these processes are integrated into overall risk management.

**Metrics and Targets:** Disclose metrics used to assess climate-related risks and opportunities. Disclose Scope 1, Scope 2, and (if appropriate) Scope 3 GHG emissions. Describe targets used and performance against them.

Scenario analysis is the most technically demanding element. TCFD expects companies to assess resilience under at least two scenarios — one consistent with a well-below-2°C transition and one reflecting higher physical risk from limited action.

## How to Implement

**Phase 1: Governance Setup (1-2 months)**
Establish board-level climate oversight (committee assignment or full board agenda). Define management responsibilities for climate risk identification and assessment. Document governance structure for disclosure purposes.

**Phase 2: Risk and Opportunity Identification (2-4 months)**
Conduct a structured assessment of physical and transition climate risks and opportunities across the value chain. Use frameworks like the NGFS scenarios for transition risk and IPCC projections for physical risk. Prioritize risks by financial materiality.

**Phase 3: Scenario Analysis (2-4 months)**
Select appropriate climate scenarios. Model business impacts under each scenario — revenue exposure, capital expenditure implications, supply chain disruption, and stranded asset risk. This doesn't require precision — directional analysis and qualitative assessment are acceptable starting points.

**Phase 4: Metrics and Disclosure (2-3 months)**
Measure and report GHG emissions following the GHG Protocol. Define climate-related targets (ideally science-based). Prepare disclosure aligned with TCFD's recommended disclosures. Publish as part of mainstream financial filings or as a standalone climate report.

## Relationship to Other Frameworks

TCFD's four-pillar structure is now embedded in virtually every major climate disclosure standard. ISSB IFRS S2 fully incorporates TCFD. ESRS E1 follows the TCFD structure. CDP's climate questionnaire is organized around TCFD. The SEC climate disclosure rule was based on TCFD. New Zealand, UK, Japan, Singapore, and other jurisdictions mandated TCFD-aligned disclosure.

TCFD works alongside the GHG Protocol (which provides the emissions measurement methodology) and SBTi (which provides the target-setting methodology). A complete TCFD disclosure typically draws on GHG Protocol data for the Metrics & Targets pillar and may reference SBTi targets.

TCFD and TNFD share the same four-pillar structure — TNFD was explicitly designed as the nature equivalent of TCFD.

## Why It Matters

TCFD fundamentally changed how companies and investors think about climate change — shifting it from a corporate social responsibility topic to a financial risk management imperative. Even though the task force itself has been disbanded, its intellectual framework is the foundation of every major climate disclosure regulation globally.

For companies, TCFD alignment is no longer optional in most major capital markets — it's mandated through ISSB adoption, CSRD/ESRS, or jurisdiction-specific regulations. Companies that haven't built TCFD-aligned climate governance, risk management, and disclosure capabilities are already behind regulatory requirements.

The framework's lasting contribution is the scenario analysis discipline — forcing companies to think systematically about how different climate futures would affect their business. This analytical rigor, more than the disclosure itself, drives strategic value by surfacing risks and opportunities that conventional planning processes miss.
