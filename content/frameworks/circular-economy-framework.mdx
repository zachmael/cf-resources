faqs:
  - question: "What is the circular economy?"
    answer: "A circular economy is an economic system that eliminates waste and pollution by design, keeps products and materials in use at their highest value, and regenerates natural systems. It contrasts with the linear 'take-make-dispose' model."
  - question: "What are the three principles of the circular economy?"
    answer: "1) Eliminate waste and pollution. 2) Circulate products and materials at their highest value. 3) Regenerate nature. These principles apply at every scale from product design to business models to economic systems."
  - question: "How does circular economy relate to climate change?"
    answer: "The Ellen MacArthur Foundation estimates that circular economy strategies in key sectors could reduce global GHG emissions by 39% — addressing the 45% of emissions that come from making and using products, which energy transition alone doesn't solve."

## What It Is

The circular economy framework, most comprehensively articulated by the Ellen MacArthur Foundation (established 2010), provides a systems-level model for economic development that decouples growth from resource consumption. It addresses the fundamental inefficiency of the linear economic model — extract, manufacture, use, dispose — which generates waste at every stage and drives environmental degradation.

The framework is built on three principles:

**Eliminate waste and pollution:** Design products, components, and materials so that waste and pollution are never created in the first place. This requires rethinking product design, manufacturing processes, and business models from the outset.

**Circulate products and materials at their highest value:** Keep products, components, and materials in use through maintenance, reuse, refurbishment, remanufacturing, and recycling — in that priority order. Higher-value circulation (reuse, remanufacture) preserves more embedded value than lower-value circulation (recycling).

**Regenerate nature:** Return biological materials to the earth safely to regenerate natural systems. Use renewable energy and materials where possible. Build natural capital rather than depleting it.

The framework distinguishes between **technical cycles** (products, components, and materials kept in circulation through reuse, repair, remanufacture, and recycling) and **biological cycles** (materials that can safely return to the biosphere as nutrients).

The "butterfly diagram" — the framework's signature visual — maps these two cycles and illustrates the inner loops (maintenance, reuse) where the most value is preserved and the outer loops (recycling, composting) where less value is retained.

## Who Uses It

- **Manufacturers** redesigning products and processes for circularity
- **Consumer goods companies** rethinking packaging, product lifecycles, and business models
- **Policymakers** developing circular economy legislation (EU Circular Economy Action Plan, national strategies)
- **Cities** implementing circular economy programs for urban systems
- **Financial institutions** investing in circular economy opportunities
- **Companies reporting under CSRD** — ESRS E5 (Resource Use and Circular Economy) requires disclosure on circular economy strategies

## Key Principles

**Design for circularity:** Products designed for longevity, repairability, modularity, and recyclability from the outset. Material selection that enables end-of-life value recovery.

**Business model innovation:** Shifting from selling products to selling services or performance (product-as-a-service), creating incentives for durability and take-back.

**Reverse logistics and recovery:** Building systems to collect, sort, and process products and materials at end of use for reintroduction into production cycles.

**Collaborative systems:** Creating industrial symbiosis networks, shared platforms, and value chain partnerships that enable material circulation across organizational boundaries.

**Metrics and measurement:** Tracking material flows, circularity rates, and resource productivity to measure progress and identify opportunities.

## How to Implement

**Phase 1: Assessment (1-3 months)**
Map material flows across the organization — inputs, outputs, waste streams, and products in use. Identify the highest-value opportunities for circular interventions. Assess product design against circular design principles.

**Phase 2: Strategy Development (2-4 months)**
Prioritize circular economy opportunities by financial return, environmental impact, and feasibility. Develop business cases for priority interventions. Consider business model innovation — can any product lines shift to service or performance models?

**Phase 3: Design and Pilot (3-6 months)**
Redesign priority products for circularity. Pilot take-back programs, remanufacturing operations, or service-based business models. Test reverse logistics and material recovery systems.

**Phase 4: Scale and Measure (ongoing)**
Scale successful pilots. Build partnerships for industrial symbiosis and material exchange. Develop circularity metrics and reporting. Integrate circular economy criteria into procurement and design processes.

## Relationship to Other Frameworks

**ESRS E5**: CSRD's Resource Use and Circular Economy standard requires disclosure on circular economy strategies, material flows, and resource use — directly connecting to the framework's principles and metrics.

**EU Circular Economy Action Plan**: EU policy draws heavily on the Ellen MacArthur Foundation's framework, with legislation on ecodesign, right to repair, packaging, and recycled content.

**GHG Protocol**: Circular economy strategies reduce emissions by avoiding virgin material production, extending product lifetimes, and reducing waste — connecting to Scope 3 categories 1, 5, and 12.

**GRI 306 (Waste)**: GRI's revised waste standard emphasizes circular economy approaches and upstream waste prevention over downstream waste management.

## Why It Matters

The circular economy framework matters because it addresses a dimension of environmental impact that climate strategy alone cannot solve. Even if the world achieves net-zero energy emissions, the extraction, processing, and disposal of materials drives 45% of total GHG emissions and the majority of biodiversity loss, water pollution, and land degradation. Transitioning to circular models is essential for staying within planetary boundaries.

For businesses, the circular economy represents a significant economic opportunity. The Ellen MacArthur Foundation estimates $4.5 trillion in economic value from circular economy strategies by 2030. Companies that redesign for circularity gain advantages in material cost reduction, supply chain resilience, regulatory readiness, customer relationships, and new revenue streams from service-based business models.
