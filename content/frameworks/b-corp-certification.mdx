faqs:
  - question: "What is the difference between B Corp certification and benefit corporation status?"
    answer: "B Corp is a third-party certification from B Lab based on verified performance. Benefit corporation is a legal structure available in many states that requires considering stakeholder interests in governance. Many B Corps are also benefit corporations, but they're separate designations."
  - question: "How long does B Corp certification take?"
    answer: "The full process typically takes 12-24 months from starting the B Impact Assessment to certification, including the assessment itself, documentation, verification review, and any improvement plans."
  - question: "What score is needed for B Corp certification?"
    answer: "Companies must achieve a verified score of 80 or above on the B Impact Assessment (out of 200 possible points). The median score for ordinary businesses completing the assessment is approximately 50.9."
  - question: "Is Council Fire a B Corp?"
    answer: "Yes. Council Fire is a certified B Corporation, reflecting our commitment to using business as a force for good. The certification process reinforced our focus on environmental and social performance alongside client service."

## What It Is

B Corp certification, administered by the nonprofit B Lab, identifies businesses that meet the highest verified standards of social and environmental performance, transparency, and accountability. Certified B Corporations balance purpose and profit, using business as a force for good.

The certification is based on the **B Impact Assessment (BIA)**, a comprehensive evaluation tool covering five impact areas: Governance, Workers, Community, Environment, and Customers. The assessment includes over 200 questions tailored by company size, sector, and geography, evaluating both operational practices and impact models (business models designed to create specific positive outcomes).

Certification requires:

1. **Verified B Impact Assessment score of 80+** (out of approximately 200 points)
2. **Legal requirement** to consider stakeholder interests in governance decisions (either through benefit corporation status or equivalent charter amendments)
3. **Transparency** — B Impact Reports are published on B Lab's website
4. **Recertification** every three years with updated assessment and verification

As of 2024, over 8,000 certified B Corps operate across 90+ countries and 160+ industries, ranging from small service firms to publicly traded multinationals.

## Who Uses It

- **Mission-driven companies** seeking third-party validation of their social and environmental practices
- **Consumer-facing brands** using B Corp certification as a trust signal (Patagonia, Ben & Jerry's, Allbirds)
- **Professional services firms** — consulting, law, accounting, design firms demonstrating values alignment
- **Companies in B2B markets** where procurement teams increasingly value supplier sustainability credentials
- **Impact investors** using B Corp status as a quality signal for investment targets
- **Council Fire** — as a certified B Corp, we walk the talk on sustainability in our own operations and governance

## Key Requirements

**Governance (up to ~25 points):** Mission and engagement, ethics and transparency, board oversight, stakeholder governance.

**Workers (up to ~50 points):** Financial security (wages, benefits, ownership), health and wellness, career development, engagement and satisfaction, diversity equity and inclusion.

**Community (up to ~50 points):** Diversity equity and inclusion of suppliers, economic impact on community, civic engagement, charitable giving, supply chain management.

**Environment (up to ~50 points):** Environmental management and assessment, air and climate (emissions, energy), water, land and life (biodiversity, land use), resource use and circular economy, environmental supply chain management.

**Customers (up to ~25 points):** Customer stewardship, data privacy and security, product quality. Impact business model points for companies whose core product/service creates specific positive outcomes.

## How to Implement

**Phase 1: Self-Assessment (1-3 months)**
Complete the B Impact Assessment online at bimpactassessment.net. Identify current score and gaps relative to the 80-point threshold. The assessment itself is free and provides valuable benchmarking regardless of certification intent.

**Phase 2: Improvement Planning (2-6 months)**
For areas below target, implement improvements — enhanced benefits, environmental management systems, governance reforms, supply chain assessments, community programs. Document all practices for verification.

**Phase 3: Submission and Verification (3-12 months)**
Submit the completed assessment for review. B Lab verification staff review documentation, conduct interviews, and may request site visits. Address any questions or findings. The verification queue varies in length.

**Phase 4: Legal Requirement and Certification**
Amend articles of incorporation or convert to benefit corporation status. Sign the B Corp Agreement and Declaration of Interdependence. Receive certification and publish B Impact Report.

**Phase 5: Recertification (every 3 years)**
Update the B Impact Assessment. Demonstrate continued or improved performance. Adapt to updated assessment criteria (B Lab regularly revises the BIA).

## Relationship to Other Frameworks

**GRI**: B Corp's Environment section and its emphasis on comprehensive impact reporting aligns with GRI's approach. B Corps often use GRI Standards for sustainability reporting.

**SDGs**: B Lab maps the B Impact Assessment to specific SDG targets, enabling B Corps to articulate their contributions to global goals.

**SBTi**: B Corps with significant emissions are increasingly expected to set science-based targets as part of their environmental performance.

**CSRD/ESRS**: While B Corp certification is distinct from CSRD compliance, the data and practices required for certification provide a strong foundation for ESRS disclosures.

## Why It Matters

B Corp certification matters because it provides a holistic, verified assessment of business impact — not just environmental metrics or financial performance, but the full picture of how a company treats workers, communities, customers, and the environment. In a market where sustainability claims are easy to make and hard to verify, B Corp certification offers meaningful third-party validation.

For Council Fire, B Corp certification reflects our conviction that sustainability consulting starts at home. We ask clients to measure their impacts, set ambitious targets, and be transparent about their performance — and we hold ourselves to the same standard. Our B Corp status isn't a marketing badge; it's a framework for continuous improvement in how we operate, who we hire, how we serve communities, and how we manage our own environmental footprint.

The B Corp movement's vision — an inclusive, equitable, and regenerative economy — aligns with the work we do every day helping organizations navigate sustainability challenges. When we recommend frameworks, targets, and strategies to our clients, we draw on our own experience implementing the same principles in our business.
