faqs:
  - question: "How many ESRS standards are there?"
    answer: "There are 12 standards: 2 cross-cutting (ESRS 1 General Requirements, ESRS 2 General Disclosures), 5 environmental (E1-E5), 4 social (S1-S4), and 1 governance (G1). Sector-specific standards are under development."
  - question: "What is double materiality under ESRS?"
    answer: "Double materiality requires assessing both impact materiality (how the company affects people and environment) and financial materiality (how sustainability issues affect the company's financial position). A topic is material if it meets either threshold."
  - question: "When do ESRS requirements take effect?"
    answer: "Large public-interest entities began reporting for FY2024 (reports published 2025). Large companies follow for FY2025. Listed SMEs for FY2026 (with opt-out until FY2028). Non-EU companies with significant EU activity for FY2028."
  - question: "Do non-EU companies need to comply with ESRS?"
    answer: "Yes, if they have €150M+ in EU net turnover and at least one EU subsidiary or branch meeting size thresholds. Simplified standards for non-EU companies are being developed."

## What It Is

The European Sustainability Reporting Standards (ESRS) are the mandatory disclosure standards developed by EFRAG (European Financial Reporting Advisory Group) under the Corporate Sustainability Reporting Directive (CSRD). They represent the most comprehensive mandatory sustainability reporting regime globally, applying double materiality and requiring detailed disclosure across environmental, social, and governance topics.

ESRS comprises 12 standards organized into three layers:

**Cross-cutting standards:** ESRS 1 (General Requirements) establishes the principles, concepts, and general requirements for sustainability reporting. ESRS 2 (General Disclosures) contains disclosures required for all companies regardless of materiality assessment — governance structure, strategy, impact/risk/opportunity management, and metrics.

**Topical standards — Environmental:** ESRS E1 (Climate Change), ESRS E2 (Pollution), ESRS E3 (Water and Marine Resources), ESRS E4 (Biodiversity and Ecosystems), ESRS E5 (Resource Use and Circular Economy).

**Topical standards — Social:** ESRS S1 (Own Workforce), ESRS S2 (Workers in the Value Chain), ESRS S3 (Affected Communities), ESRS S4 (Consumers and End-Users).

**Topical standards — Governance:** ESRS G1 (Business Conduct).

Companies must disclose on all topics determined to be material through a double materiality assessment. ESRS E1 (Climate Change) has a rebuttable presumption of materiality — companies must disclose unless they can demonstrate climate is not material (a high bar).

ESRS requires disclosure of policies, actions, targets, and metrics for each material topic, including forward-looking information about transition plans and their financial implications.

## Who Uses It

- **EU-listed companies and large EU companies** — approximately 50,000 companies in scope
- **Non-EU companies** with significant EU operations (€150M+ EU turnover) — starting FY2028
- **Companies in the value chain** of ESRS-reporting entities — increasingly requested to provide data for their customers' ESRS disclosures
- **Auditors and assurance providers** — ESRS disclosures require limited assurance initially, moving to reasonable assurance
- **Financial institutions** using ESRS data for sustainable finance regulation compliance (SFDR, EU Taxonomy)

## Key Requirements

1. **Double materiality assessment** — systematic process assessing both impact materiality and financial materiality across all ESRS topics
2. **Mandatory disclosures** under ESRS 2 regardless of materiality — governance, strategy, IRO management
3. **Topic-specific disclosures** for all material topics — policies, actions and resources, targets, and metrics
4. **Value chain coverage** — disclosures must cover impacts, risks, and opportunities across the upstream and downstream value chain
5. **Connectivity with financial statements** — sustainability information must be connected to financial reporting
6. **Digital tagging** — ESRS disclosures must be tagged in XBRL format for machine readability
7. **External assurance** — limited assurance required initially, with plans to move to reasonable assurance

## How to Implement

**Phase 1: Scoping and Governance (2-3 months)**
Determine your reporting timeline based on company size and listing status. Establish governance — board oversight, management roles, cross-functional reporting team. Engage external auditors early.

**Phase 2: Double Materiality Assessment (3-5 months)**
Follow ESRS 1 and EFRAG implementation guidance. Identify actual and potential impacts (positive and negative) across the value chain. Assess financial materiality of sustainability-related risks and opportunities. Engage stakeholders. Document the assessment process thoroughly — it will be audited.

**Phase 3: Gap Analysis and Data Infrastructure (3-6 months)**
Map material topics to specific ESRS disclosure requirements. Identify data gaps. Build or enhance data collection systems. Establish data quality controls suitable for external assurance.

**Phase 4: Disclosure Development (3-4 months)**
Prepare disclosures for each material ESRS topic. Develop the management report section. Ensure connectivity with financial statements. Tag in XBRL format. Prepare for assurance engagement.

## Relationship to Other Frameworks

**GRI**: ESRS was developed in collaboration with GRI and shares significant alignment. EFRAG and GRI published an interoperability guide. Companies with existing GRI reports have a meaningful head start.

**ISSB**: ESRS and ISSB share structural similarities (four-pillar architecture, same topic coverage) but differ on materiality — ESRS uses double materiality while ISSB uses financial materiality. EFRAG published an interoperability assessment showing high alignment on climate disclosures.

**TCFD**: ESRS E1 (Climate) fully incorporates TCFD recommendations within its disclosure requirements.

**EU Taxonomy**: ESRS requires disclosure of EU Taxonomy-eligible and aligned activities, connecting sustainability reporting to the EU's green investment framework.

## Why It Matters

ESRS represents a paradigm shift in sustainability reporting — from voluntary, flexible, and investor-focused to mandatory, standardized, and stakeholder-comprehensive. The double materiality requirement means companies must account not just for how sustainability affects their finances, but for how they affect the world.

The practical implications are enormous. Approximately 50,000 companies must comply, many of which have never produced structured sustainability disclosures. The requirement for external assurance elevates sustainability data to financial reporting standards of rigor. And the value chain coverage requirement means that ESRS-reporting companies will, in turn, request sustainability data from their suppliers and customers — extending the reporting obligation far beyond the companies directly in scope.

Companies that view ESRS as a compliance burden will struggle. Those that use it as a catalyst for genuine sustainability integration — improving data infrastructure, strengthening governance, and connecting sustainability to business strategy — will find that the reporting process itself drives operational improvement.
