faqs:
  - question: "What is a green bond?"
    answer: "A green bond is a fixed-income instrument where proceeds are exclusively used to finance projects with environmental benefits — renewable energy, energy efficiency, clean transportation, water management, and other green categories."
  - question: "What is the difference between Climate Bonds Standard and ICMA Green Bond Principles?"
    answer: "ICMA GBP are voluntary guidelines focused on process (use of proceeds, project evaluation, reporting). The Climate Bonds Standard is a certification scheme with science-based criteria for specific asset classes — more prescriptive and independently verified."
  - question: "How big is the green bond market?"
    answer: "The global green bond market exceeded $500 billion in annual issuance in 2023, with cumulative issuance over $2.5 trillion. Climate Bonds Initiative tracks and certifies a significant portion of this market."

## What It Is

The Climate Bonds Standard (CBS) is a certification scheme developed by the Climate Bonds Initiative (CBI) that provides science-based criteria for certifying bonds and loans as genuinely contributing to climate change solutions. First published in 2012 and updated through Version 4.0, the Standard ensures that certified instruments finance assets and projects consistent with achieving the goals of the Paris Agreement.

The Standard comprises a framework document (Climate Bonds Standard V4.0) and a growing library of sector-specific criteria covering energy, transport, water, buildings, land use, industry, waste, and information and communications technology. Each sector criteria document defines the specific requirements that projects and assets must meet for certification.

Certification involves pre-issuance review (confirming planned use of proceeds) and post-issuance verification (confirming actual allocation and compliance), conducted by approved verifiers. Certified bonds carry the Climate Bonds Certified mark, providing investors with assurance that the instrument meets science-based climate standards.

## Who Uses It

- **Bond issuers** — corporations, municipalities, sovereign entities, and development banks seeking certification for green bond issuances
- **Institutional investors** — pension funds, insurers, and asset managers using CBS certification as a quality filter for green bond investments
- **Underwriters** — investment banks structuring and marketing certified green bonds
- **Regulators** — several jurisdictions reference CBS criteria in their green bond regulations and taxonomies

## Key Requirements

1. **Use of Proceeds**: Net proceeds must be allocated to eligible green projects/assets meeting sector-specific criteria
2. **Sector Criteria Compliance**: Assets must meet science-based criteria for their sector — energy efficiency thresholds, emissions intensity limits, technology eligibility
3. **Pre-Issuance Certification**: Independent verifier confirms conformance before issuance
4. **Post-Issuance Reporting**: Annual reporting on allocation of proceeds and environmental impact
5. **Post-Issuance Verification**: Independent verifier confirms actual allocation within 24 months
6. **V4.0 Additions**: Enhanced transition criteria, adaptation & resilience certification, entity-level requirements including SBTi-aligned targets for corporate issuers

## How to Implement

**Phase 1: Assess Eligibility (1-2 months)**
Identify assets/projects intended for bond proceeds. Assess against relevant sector criteria. Determine if certification is feasible.

**Phase 2: Framework Development (1-2 months)**
Develop green bond framework describing use of proceeds, project evaluation, proceeds management, and reporting commitments. Align with both CBS and ICMA GBP.

**Phase 3: Pre-Issuance Verification (2-4 weeks)**
Engage an approved verifier. Provide evidence of asset eligibility. Receive verification report and certification.

**Phase 4: Issuance and Post-Issuance (ongoing)**
Issue the bond. Allocate proceeds to eligible projects. Report annually. Complete post-issuance verification within 24 months.

## Relationship to Other Frameworks

**ICMA Green Bond Principles**: CBS builds on and adds scientific rigor to ICMA's process-focused guidelines. Most certified bonds comply with both.

**EU Green Bond Standard**: The EU GBS draws on similar principles and is broadly aligned with CBS, though with specific EU Taxonomy alignment requirements.

**EU Taxonomy**: CBS sector criteria are increasingly aligned with EU Taxonomy technical screening criteria, facilitating dual compliance.

**SBTi**: CBS V4.0 introduces entity-level requirements including expectations for science-based targets from corporate issuers.

## Why It Matters

The Climate Bonds Standard matters because it provides the quality assurance layer that green bond markets need to maintain credibility. As green bond issuance grows, so does the risk of greenwashing — bonds labeled "green" without rigorous criteria for what qualifies. CBS certification, with its science-based sector criteria and independent verification, provides investors with confidence that their capital is financing genuine climate solutions.

For issuers, certification provides market credibility, pricing advantages (green bonds typically achieve 2-8 basis point premium), and investor access. For the broader market, CBS helps channel the trillions in climate investment needed toward projects that actually deliver climate outcomes.
