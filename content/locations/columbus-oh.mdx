## Climate Snapshot

Columbus is Ohio's capital and largest city, with a population of approximately 913,000 and a metro area of 2.1 million. The city sprawls across central Ohio's relatively flat terrain, drained by the Scioto River and its tributaries—Olentangy River, Alum Creek, and Big Walnut Creek. Columbus's rapid growth, particularly westward and southward annexation, has consumed agricultural land and expanded impervious surfaces, increasing stormwater volumes in watersheds with limited natural storage capacity.

In June 2022, a line of severe thunderstorms dropped 4 inches of rain in two hours across Franklin County, flooding homes along Alum Creek and the south side. The event caused $45 million in damages and triggered 150 swift-water rescues. In March 2024, rapid snowmelt combined with heavy rain pushed the Scioto River to its highest level since 2018, flooding the Franklinton neighborhood—a historically flood-prone area that was devastated by the Great Flood of 1913. Franklinton's $150 million floodwall, completed in 2004, held, but areas outside its protection sustained significant damage.

Columbus recorded its warmest year on record in 2023, with an average temperature 3.1°F above normal. The city experienced 33 days above 90°F, compared to a historical average of 18. Rapid population growth—Columbus added 130,000 residents between 2010 and 2023—continues to strain infrastructure and expand climate exposure.

## Top Climate Risks

### Riverine and Urban Flooding
Columbus sits at the confluence of multiple waterways, and flooding is the city's most costly climate risk. Franklin County's floodplain contains over 5,000 structures with a combined value exceeding $3.5 billion. The Franklinton floodwall protects the most concentrated area, but other neighborhoods—particularly along Alum Creek and Big Walnut Creek—lack equivalent protection. The city's combined sewer system serves the urban core and overflows during moderate rain events, with Columbus's Department of Public Utilities estimating 2.5 billion gallons of CSO annually. Climate projections show a 20% increase in extreme rainfall by 2050.

### Extreme Heat
Columbus's flat, sprawling development pattern creates expansive heat islands. A 2023 Ohio State University heat mapping study found temperature differentials of up to 14°F between industrial corridors on the south side and tree-canopy-rich neighborhoods in Clintonville and Upper Arlington. The study identified that 72% of Columbus's highest-heat census tracts are majority non-white. Cooling degree days have increased 28% since 2000, driving up energy costs for the 25% of Columbus households that are energy-burdened.

### Water Supply Stress
Columbus depends on surface water reservoirs—Hoover, O'Shaughnessy, and Griggs—fed by the Scioto and Big Walnut Creek systems. Drought in 2012 and 2016 dropped reservoir levels to concerning thresholds, and the city's water demand has increased 15% since 2010 due to population growth and Intel's $20 billion semiconductor facility in adjacent Licking County, which will require up to 5 million gallons of water daily. Climate models project more variable precipitation patterns that could stress the reservoir system during summer months.

## Local Climate Action

Columbus adopted its Green Columbus initiative in 2020, which evolved into the Columbus Climate Action Plan (2022), targeting carbon neutrality by 2050 with an interim 45% reduction by 2030 from a 2019 baseline. The plan was developed in partnership with the Byrd Polar and Climate Research Center at Ohio State University.

The city won the U.S. Department of Transportation's Smart City Challenge in 2016, securing $50 million for connected mobility infrastructure. This evolved into the Smart Columbus initiative, which deployed electric vehicle charging infrastructure, connected vehicle technology, and mobility-as-a-service platforms. Columbus has installed over 1,200 public EV charging ports across the city.

Columbus's Blueprint Columbus program, launched in 2015, is a $1.8 billion initiative to separate combined sewers and install green infrastructure across the city over 20 years. As of 2024, the program had completed over 60 neighborhood projects, managing 1.2 billion gallons of stormwater through green infrastructure including rain gardens, bioswales, and permeable pavement.

## Regulations & Incentives

Ohio's regulatory environment for climate action is limited at the state level, but Columbus has taken aggressive local action. The city's Sustainable Columbus 2050 framework guides development standards, and the updated Columbus Building Code (2023) incorporates the 2021 IECC for energy efficiency.

Columbus's stormwater utility fee provides credits of up to 50% for properties managing stormwater on-site. The Blueprint Columbus program provides free green infrastructure installations in targeted neighborhoods, with ongoing maintenance funded through the stormwater utility. AEP Ohio, the primary electric utility, offers net metering, an energy efficiency rebate program, and a community solar option.

Franklin County's Green Building Initiative provides expedited permitting and fee reductions for LEED-certified projects. The Mid-Ohio Regional Planning Commission offers grants for energy efficiency improvements in low-income housing, with $2 million allocated annually from CDBG funds.

## Federal Funding Opportunities

Ohio's IRA Home Energy Rebate allocation is $238 million. Columbus residents can access up to $8,000 for heat pump installations and $14,000 for income-qualified households. Federal 30% tax credits for solar, batteries, and efficiency improvements are available through 2032.

FEMA BRIC has funded Columbus flood mitigation, with $10.5 million awarded in 2023 for Alum Creek corridor projects including property acquisitions and floodplain restoration. The EPA's Water Infrastructure Finance and Innovation Act (WIFIA) has provided $400 million in low-interest loans to Columbus for the Blueprint Columbus sewer separation program.

The DOT's Smart City legacy continues with RAISE and SS4A grant programs. Columbus received $15 million in RAISE funding in 2022 for the Livingston Avenue Complete Streets project. The DOE's allocation to Ohio for Weatherization ($55 million in 2023) supports Columbus's low-income energy efficiency work. The CHIPS Act's investment in the Intel facility creates adjacent opportunities for sustainable infrastructure planning.
