## Climate Snapshot

New York City — 8.3 million residents across five boroughs, 520 miles of coastline, and $1.7 trillion in coastal property exposure — faces climate risks at a scale matched by few cities on earth. The city's density, aging infrastructure, and geographic vulnerability create a compounding risk profile that demands sophisticated, multi-hazard resilience planning.

Hurricane Sandy in October 2012 remains the defining climate event. A 14-foot storm surge at Battery Park flooded Lower Manhattan, the Brooklyn-Queens waterfront, and Staten Island's South Shore, killing 44 New Yorkers and causing $19 billion in damages citywide. Twelve years later, Hurricane Ida's remnants in September 2021 killed 13 people — 11 of them in basement apartments — when 3.15 inches of rain fell in a single hour in Central Park, shattering the all-time record.

Sea levels at the Battery tide gauge have risen 12 inches since 1900. The New York City Panel on Climate Change (NPCC) projects an additional 8–30 inches by 2050 and up to 6 feet by 2100 under high-emission scenarios. Combined with land subsidence and the city's funnel-shaped harbor, these projections put hundreds of thousands of residents and tens of billions in property at risk.

## Top Climate Risks

### Coastal & Inland Flooding

NYC's 520 miles of coastline and low-lying neighborhoods make flooding the city's paramount risk. FEMA's revised Flood Insurance Rate Maps place over 400,000 New Yorkers in the 100-year floodplain. Post-Sandy analysis by the Mayor's Office identified $100 billion in assets within the flood zone. Inland flooding from extreme rainfall — like Ida — affects neighborhoods far from the coast, particularly in Queens, Brooklyn, and the Bronx where combined sewers overflow during heavy storms.

### Extreme Heat

NYC experiences an average of 18 days above 90°F annually, projected to reach 45+ days by 2050. Heat kills more New Yorkers than any other extreme weather event — an average of 350 excess deaths per year. Environmental justice neighborhoods in the South Bronx, Central Brooklyn, and Northern Manhattan experience the worst heat due to limited tree canopy, dense impervious surfaces, and higher rates of chronic illness.

### Sea Level Rise

The NPCC's 2024 report projects 8–30 inches of sea level rise by the 2050s at the Battery. At 2 feet of rise, routine high tides would flood the FDR Drive, portions of the A/C subway tunnels in Lower Manhattan, and the Red Hook waterfront. LaGuardia Airport's runways sit 7 feet above current mean sea level — among the most exposed major airport infrastructure in the country.

## Local Climate Action

NYC's PlaNYC: Getting Sustainability Done (2023 update) consolidates the city's climate commitments: 80% GHG reduction by 2050 (80x50) relative to 2005, with a 40% interim target by 2030 already codified in Local Law 97. The city has invested $20 billion in coastal resilience since Sandy, including the East Side Coastal Resiliency Project — a $1.45 billion flood protection system along the Lower East Side — and the $3.7 billion Red Hook Integrated Flood Protection System.

Local Law 97 (2019) is the most aggressive building emissions law in the nation, requiring buildings over 25,000 square feet to meet carbon intensity limits starting in 2024, with stricter caps in 2030. The law covers roughly 50,000 buildings responsible for nearly 60% of the city's total emissions. Penalties of $268 per metric ton of CO2 over the limit create significant financial exposure for non-compliant owners.

The NYC Mayor's Office of Climate & Environmental Justice coordinates adaptation planning, while the NYC Department of Environmental Protection's $2.4 billion Green Infrastructure Program installs bioswales, rain gardens, and permeable surfaces to reduce combined sewer overflow volumes.

## Regulations & Incentives

Local Law 97 is the centerpiece regulation. Buildings over 25,000 square feet face 2024 emissions limits (most commercial buildings received compliant thresholds) and significantly stricter 2030 limits that will require active decarbonization. The NYC Accelerator program provides free advisory services for building owners navigating compliance. The Property Assessed Clean Energy (PACE) program enables long-term financing for energy efficiency and renewable energy upgrades.

New York State's Climate Leadership and Community Protection Act (CLCPA, 2019) mandates 70% renewable electricity by 2030, 100% zero-emission electricity by 2040, and 85% economy-wide emissions reduction by 2050. The NY-Sun program offers incentives for commercial and residential solar, while NYSERDA's Clean Heat program provides incentives for heat pump installations.

The city's Carbon Trading Study (2023) explored creating a compliance market for Local Law 97 credits, which could lower costs for building owners who exceed targets. NYC's Solar Property Tax Abatement provides a four-year tax abatement equal to 20% of solar installation costs for commercial buildings.

## Federal Funding Opportunities

NYC received $16 billion in federal Sandy recovery and resilience funding, primarily through HUD's CDBG-DR program. The Army Corps' New York & New Jersey Harbor and Tributaries Study (HATS) is a $52 billion proposal for regional flood risk management, including storm surge barriers at the Verrazano Narrows — the largest resilience infrastructure study in U.S. history.

FEMA's BRIC program awarded New York State $80 million in FY2023, with NYC projects among the largest recipients. The IRA provides significant opportunities: the 179D commercial building deduction (up to $5/sq ft) directly supports LL97 compliance, and the 30% Investment Tax Credit accelerates solar and storage deployment. The EPA's Climate Pollution Reduction Grants allocated $3 million to New York for planning.

The DOT's RAISE and INFRA grant programs support climate-resilient transportation infrastructure. The MTA's $55 billion capital program (2025–2029) includes flood hardening of subway stations and signal systems — consultant opportunities exist across design, environmental review, and implementation.

## How Council Fire Can Help

Council Fire's experience at the intersection of federal funding strategy, coastal resilience engineering, and sustainability policy makes us a strong fit for New York's complex institutional landscape. Our work with NOAA on coastal science, the U.S. Army on infrastructure resilience, and the Environmental Defense Fund on ocean ecosystems gives us technical depth across the marine, built environment, and policy domains that converge in NYC.

For building owners facing Local Law 97 compliance, we provide decarbonization roadmaps that integrate IRA incentives, NYSERDA programs, and PACE financing to minimize out-of-pocket costs. For agencies and developers involved in waterfront projects, our coastal resilience planning experience — including work with the Resilience Authority of Annapolis on similar tidal flooding challenges — translates directly to NYC's Lower Manhattan and Brooklyn waterfront priorities.

## Frequently Asked Questions

### What are the biggest climate risks facing New York City?

Coastal and inland flooding represent the greatest threat — 400,000+ residents live in the 100-year floodplain, and extreme rainfall events like Hurricane Ida's remnants can overwhelm areas far from the coast. Extreme heat kills an estimated 350 New Yorkers annually. Sea level rise of 8–30 inches by 2050 will compound both flooding and infrastructure vulnerability.

### Does New York City have a climate action plan?

Yes. PlaNYC (2023 update) targets 80% emissions reduction by 2050, with Local Law 97 requiring buildings over 25,000 square feet to meet carbon intensity limits starting in 2024. The city has invested $20 billion in coastal resilience since Hurricane Sandy, including the $1.45 billion East Side Coastal Resiliency Project.

### What federal funding is available for climate resilience in New York?

NYC has received $16 billion in post-Sandy federal funding. The Army Corps' $52 billion HATS study proposes regional surge barriers. FEMA BRIC awarded New York State $80 million in FY2023. IRA tax credits directly support LL97 compliance. HUD CDBG-DR, DOT RAISE grants, and EPA Climate Pollution Reduction Grants provide additional funding pathways.

### What is Local Law 97 and how does it affect building owners?

Local Law 97 requires buildings over 25,000 square feet to meet carbon emissions intensity limits, with penalties of $268 per metric ton of CO2 over the cap. Initial limits took effect in 2024, with significantly stricter limits in 2030. The law covers about 50,000 buildings responsible for nearly 60% of NYC's total emissions.
