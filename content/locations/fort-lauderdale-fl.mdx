## Climate Snapshot

Fort Lauderdale spans a low-lying coastal plain in Broward County, crisscrossed by 165 miles of canals that earned it the "Venice of America" nickname—and now make it one of the most flood-vulnerable cities in the United States. The city's average elevation is just 5 feet above sea level, with significant areas below 3 feet. Porous limestone bedrock means seawalls alone cannot stop rising groundwater; water literally comes up through the ground.

Southeast Florida has warmed roughly 2°F since the 1960s, and the Virginia Key tide gauge (the nearest long-term station) shows approximately 12 inches of sea level rise over the past century, accelerating to about 1 inch every 3 years in recent decades. The Southeast Florida Regional Climate Change Compact—a pioneering four-county partnership including Broward—projects 10 to 17 inches of additional rise by 2040 and 21 to 54 inches by 2060.

April 2023 underscored the city's vulnerability when 25 inches of rain fell in 24 hours, overwhelming drainage systems, flooding Fort Lauderdale-Hollywood International Airport, and damaging over 1,000 structures. That event—a 1-in-1,000-year rainfall—may become far more common as the atmosphere holds more moisture in a warming climate.

## Top Climate Risks

### Sea Level Rise & Groundwater Intrusion

Fort Lauderdale's porous limestone foundation makes conventional flood barriers ineffective against rising seas. Groundwater tables are already within inches of the surface in many neighborhoods, causing septic system failures, foundation damage, and saltwater intrusion into the Biscayne Aquifer—the region's sole drinking water source. The Compact's Unified Sea Level Rise Projection estimates that by 2060, high-tide flooding could affect areas currently home to 100,000+ residents.

### Extreme Rainfall & Urban Flooding

The April 2023 flood event was not an anomaly—Fort Lauderdale has experienced four 100-year rainfall events since 2018. The city's stormwater system, designed for 5-year storms, cannot handle the intensifying rainfall that climate models project for Southeast Florida. Low-lying neighborhoods like Edgewood, Sailboat Bend, and Progresso see standing water from as little as 3 inches of rain in an hour.

### Hurricane & Storm Surge

While Fort Lauderdale has not taken a direct major hurricane hit since Wilma (2005), the region remains in the crosshairs. A Category 4 storm on a worst-case track could push 10–15 feet of surge into the Intracoastal Waterway and New River corridor. With over $35 billion in insured coastal property in Broward County, the financial exposure is staggering. King tides already flood waterfront properties multiple times per year without any storm.

## Local Climate Action

Fort Lauderdale's Resilience Strategy, adopted in 2020 and updated in 2024, is one of the most comprehensive municipal resilience frameworks in the Southeast. The city has committed to carbon neutrality for municipal operations by 2040 and community-wide net-zero by 2050.

The city is investing $400 million over 10 years in stormwater infrastructure, including pump stations, backflow preventers, raised seawalls, and green infrastructure. The Stormwater Master Plan update (2024) redesigns the system for the 25-year storm with 2060 sea level rise conditions—a significant upgrade from the 5-year design standard.

Broward County's Climate Change Action Plan (2024 update) includes 75 priority actions spanning energy, transportation, water, and natural systems. The county has installed 15 MW of solar on government facilities, converted 40% of its fleet to alternative fuels, and launched a green building incentive program.

## Regulations & Incentives

Broward County requires all new construction in the coastal high-hazard area to meet the Florida Building Code plus 1 foot of freeboard above BFE. The county's Sea Level Rise Ordinance (2023) requires development applications to evaluate vulnerability to 2060 sea level rise projections.

Florida's PACE program is widely used in Broward for wind hardening, flood adaptation, and solar installations. The county's Green Business Certification program provides marketing benefits and permit fee reductions for businesses meeting sustainability criteria.

FPL's net metering program, combined with the state's solar sales tax exemption and property tax exemption for solar improvements, makes rooftop solar highly cost-effective. FPL also offers commercial demand response and energy audit programs.

## Federal Funding Opportunities

The Army Corps of Engineers' South Atlantic Coastal Study identified Southeast Florida as a priority area, and a Broward County-specific feasibility study for coastal storm risk management is underway, with potential federal investment exceeding $1 billion.

FEMA BRIC and FMA programs are major funding sources—Broward County has received over $30 million in FEMA mitigation grants since 2020, primarily for stormwater pump stations and property acquisition.

The EPA's Clean Water State Revolving Fund (CWSRF) provides below-market financing for stormwater and water infrastructure projects. Broward County has accessed over $100 million in SRF loans for water and sewer resilience upgrades.

HUD's CDBG-DR allocation following the April 2023 flooding is providing additional recovery and resilience funding to Broward County.

## How Council Fire Can Help

Council Fire supports Southeast Florida's most climate-exposed communities with integrated resilience and sustainability solutions. In Fort Lauderdale, we work on stormwater infrastructure planning, federal grant strategy, and climate vulnerability assessments that account for the region's unique hydrogeology.

Our team helps developers and building owners navigate Broward's evolving sea level rise regulations, secure PACE financing, and achieve green building certifications. For municipal clients, we provide hazard mitigation plan development, BRIC application support, and long-term capital planning that integrates climate projections into infrastructure investment decisions.

## Frequently Asked Questions

### Why does Fort Lauderdale flood even without a storm?

Fort Lauderdale's porous limestone bedrock allows groundwater to rise with the tide and with sea level rise. Unlike cities that can build higher seawalls, Fort Lauderdale faces "sunshine flooding" because water seeps up from below. King tides, which occur several times per year, push groundwater to the surface in low-lying areas, flooding streets and yards without a drop of rain.

### How much will flood insurance cost in Fort Lauderdale?

Under FEMA's Risk Rating 2.0, Fort Lauderdale flood insurance premiums vary dramatically by property. Waterfront properties with low first-floor elevations may pay $5,000–$15,000+ annually, while elevated inland properties may pay under $1,000. The average premium in Broward County increased roughly 15% from 2023 to 2025. Elevation certificates and mitigation measures can significantly reduce costs.

### What is the Southeast Florida Regional Climate Change Compact?

The Compact is a partnership among Broward, Miami-Dade, Palm Beach, and Monroe counties formed in 2010 to coordinate climate adaptation across jurisdictional boundaries. It produces the Unified Sea Level Rise Projection (updated every 5 years), develops regional policy recommendations, and coordinates federal advocacy. It's widely regarded as a national model for regional climate collaboration.

### Is Fort Lauderdale's drinking water at risk from sea level rise?

Yes. The Biscayne Aquifer, which supplies drinking water to 6 million South Floridians, is vulnerable to saltwater intrusion as sea levels rise and groundwater tables shift. Broward County's water utilities are investing in aquifer recharge, alternative water supplies (including reclaimed water), and saltwater intrusion monitoring. The long-term viability of the Biscayne Aquifer is one of Southeast Florida's most critical climate challenges.
