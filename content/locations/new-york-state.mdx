## Climate Snapshot

New York State's 20 million residents span a geography from the Atlantic coastline and New York City through the Hudson Valley, across the Catskills and Adirondacks, to the Great Lakes shore at Buffalo. The state has warmed approximately 2.4°F since 1970—faster than the global average—with winter temperatures rising most dramatically (4°F+), reducing snowpack, shortening ice seasons, and altering precipitation patterns statewide.

Sea level at the Battery in New York Harbor has risen approximately 12 inches since 1900, and the New York City Panel on Climate Change projects an additional 8 to 30 inches by 2050 and 15 to 75 inches by 2100. Hurricane Sandy (2012) demonstrated the catastrophic convergence of storm surge, sea level rise, and dense coastal development, causing $19 billion in damage to New York City alone and killing 43 people statewide.

New York's economy—the third-largest state GDP at $2 trillion—faces diverse climate exposure: financial services and real estate concentrated in flood-prone Lower Manhattan, agriculture across the Hudson Valley and western counties, tourism in the Adirondacks and Catskills, and energy infrastructure spanning the state. The Climate Leadership and Community Protection Act (CLCPA, 2019) positions New York as a national leader in climate action.

## Top Climate Risks

### Coastal & Inland Flooding

New York City's 520 miles of coastline contain over $100 billion in property within the current 100-year floodplain. Sandy's surge reached 14 feet at the Battery. But flooding extends well beyond the coast: remnants of Hurricane Ida (2021) killed 13 New Yorkers—11 of them in basement apartments in Queens—from extreme rainfall flooding. Buffalo, Rochester, and Syracuse face Great Lakes-driven flooding, and the Mohawk Valley experiences riverine flood events with increasing frequency.

### Extreme Heat

New York City averages 18 days per year above 90°F, projected to reach 35–55 days by 2050. The city's dense urban fabric creates heat islands 7–10°F warmer than surrounding areas. Heat is already New York City's deadliest weather hazard, causing an estimated 350 excess deaths annually. Upstate cities—Albany, Syracuse, Rochester—face heat adaptation challenges with building stock designed for cold winters, not hot summers.

### Extreme Precipitation & Stormwater

New York State has experienced a 70% increase in heavy precipitation events since the 1950s—the largest increase of any Northeast state. The state's aging stormwater and sewer infrastructure (much of it combined storm-sanitary systems built in the 19th and early 20th centuries) cannot handle intensifying rainfall. Combined sewer overflows discharge over 27 billion gallons of untreated sewage and stormwater into New York's waterways annually.

## Local Climate Action

The CLCPA (2019) is among the nation's most ambitious state climate laws, mandating 40% emissions reduction by 2030 and 85% by 2050 (from 1990 levels), with a net-zero economy-wide target. The law requires 70% renewable electricity by 2030 and 100% zero-emission electricity by 2040. The Climate Action Council's Scoping Plan (2022) outlines implementation across buildings, transportation, electricity, industry, agriculture, and waste.

New York City's Local Law 97 (2019) caps building emissions for structures over 25,000 sq ft, with first compliance period beginning in 2024 and increasingly strict limits through 2050. The law affects roughly 50,000 buildings and represents the most aggressive building decarbonization mandate in the nation.

The state's $4.2 billion Environmental Bond Act (2022) funds climate resilience, water infrastructure, open space conservation, and environmental justice projects. The NY Forward and Downtown Revitalization Initiative programs integrate resilience into community development investments.

## Regulations & Incentives

New York's regulatory framework includes: CLCPA emissions mandates, Local Law 97 building performance standards (NYC), the All-Electric Building Act (2023, banning fossil fuel equipment in new buildings starting 2026/2029), cap-and-invest program (under development), and the Accelerated Renewable Energy Growth Act.

NYSERDA administers over $1 billion annually in clean energy incentives, including NY-Sun (solar), Clean Heat (heat pumps), and EmPower+ (low-income efficiency). The state's NY Green Bank provides $1 billion in financing for clean energy projects. Con Edison, National Grid, and NYSEG offer utility-funded energy efficiency and demand response programs.

New York's Community Risk and Resiliency Act requires sea level rise and flood projections in certain state permits, facility siting, and hazard mitigation planning—embedding climate science into routine regulatory decisions.

## Federal Funding Opportunities

New York received $15 billion in FEMA disaster assistance for Hurricane Sandy alone, plus over $4 billion in HUD CDBG-DR for recovery and resilience. The Sandy-funded programs (Build It Back, NYC Coastal Resiliency) continue to shape the city's adaptation infrastructure.

The Army Corps' New York-New Jersey Harbor and Tributaries Study (HATS) is evaluating a multi-billion-dollar coastal storm risk management system for the New York metropolitan area, including surge barriers, floodwalls, and nature-based features. The recommended plan could exceed $50 billion.

The IRA and BIL direct significant resources to New York through DOE formula and competitive programs, EPA CWSRF/DWSRF, DOT RAISE/INFRA, and FEMA BRIC. New York's CPRG allocation supports the state's climate action plan implementation.

The EPA's Climate Pollution Reduction Grants and the Greenhouse Gas Reduction Fund's national green bank network (including NY Green Bank) provide substantial financing for New York's clean energy transition.

## How Council Fire Can Help

Council Fire supports New York clients across the state's ambitious climate policy landscape. In New York City, we help building owners navigate Local Law 97 compliance, develop decarbonization roadmaps, and access NYSERDA and utility incentives. Our resilience practice supports coastal adaptation planning, FEMA grant strategy, and Army Corps coordination.

For upstate communities, we provide hazard mitigation planning, stormwater master planning, and Environmental Bond Act project development. Our corporate sustainability practice helps New York businesses meet CLCPA-aligned supply chain expectations and develop credible climate transition plans.

## Frequently Asked Questions

### What is Local Law 97 and who does it affect?

Local Law 97 caps greenhouse gas emissions from New York City buildings over 25,000 square feet—roughly 50,000 buildings covering 60% of the city's building area. The first compliance period (2024–2029) sets carbon intensity limits that most buildings can meet through operational improvements. The 2030–2034 limits are significantly stricter, likely requiring electrification, envelope upgrades, or renewable energy procurement. Penalties are $268 per metric ton of CO2 over the limit. Building owners should benchmark emissions, commission energy audits, and develop decarbonization plans now.

### How is New York protecting against another Sandy?

Multiple strategies are underway: the Army Corps' HATS study is evaluating regional surge barriers and coastal defenses (potential $50B+ investment). NYC has invested over $20 billion in coastal resilience since Sandy, including the East Side Coastal Resiliency project (2.4 miles of flood protection along the East River), the Hunts Point Lifelines project, and the Living Breakwaters pilot in Staten Island. The city's updated floodplain maps and Climate Resiliency Design Guidelines shape new development in flood-prone areas.

### What does the All-Electric Building Act mean for new construction?

Effective January 2026 for buildings under 7 stories and 2029 for taller buildings, the Act prohibits fossil fuel combustion equipment (furnaces, boilers, water heaters, stoves) in new construction. Developers must use electric heat pumps, induction cooking, and electric water heating. Exceptions exist for hospitals, commercial kitchens, emergency generators, and manufacturing processes. The law accelerates New York's building decarbonization trajectory and is expected to reduce gas infrastructure investment while increasing electricity demand.

### What funding is available from the Environmental Bond Act?

The $4.2 billion Environmental Bond Act (approved by voters in 2022) allocates: $1.5 billion for climate change mitigation, $1.1 billion for restoration and flood risk reduction, $650 million for open space conservation, and $650 million for water quality improvement. Local governments, nonprofits, and state agencies are eligible for grants. Priority is given to projects benefiting disadvantaged communities (at least 35% of funding). Applications are administered through DEC, EFC, and other state agencies.
