## Climate Snapshot

Sacramento, California's capital, has a population of 525,000 in the city and 2.4 million in the metro area. The city sits at the confluence of the Sacramento and American Rivers in the heart of California's Central Valley—a position that makes it the most flood-vulnerable city in the United States by some measures. Over 300,000 residents live behind a network of levees originally built in the early 1900s, many of which do not meet modern engineering standards.

Sacramento is also one of the fastest-warming cities in California. In September 2022, the city recorded a stretch of 10 consecutive days above 110°F during an unprecedented heat dome that killed dozens across the state. The historical average of 13 days above 100°F is projected to more than double by 2050. Wildfire smoke from Sierra Nevada and Northern California fires regularly blankets the Sacramento Valley—the 2020 and 2021 fire seasons each produced weeks of unhealthy air quality.

The January 2023 atmospheric river sequence tested Sacramento's flood defenses. Rivers rose to dangerous levels, several Central Valley levees were damaged, and the region narrowly avoided catastrophic flooding. The event underscored what hydrologists have warned: a repeat of the 1862 "Great Flood"—which inundated the entire Central Valley—is not a matter of if but when.

## Top Climate Risks

### Catastrophic Flooding

Sacramento faces the highest per-capita flood risk of any major U.S. city. The 100-year floodplain encompasses 100,000 structures with $35 billion in assessed value. The levee system protecting the city includes 140 miles of state and federal levees, many built to standards that predate modern engineering. An ARkStorm scenario—a sequence of atmospheric rivers similar to the 1862 event—could produce $1 trillion in damages statewide, with Sacramento at the epicenter. The Sacramento Area Flood Control Agency (SAFCA) has invested $1.7 billion in levee improvements since the mid-1990s, but significant gaps remain.

### Extreme Heat

Sacramento's inland valley location produces summer temperatures that exceed coastal California cities by 20–30°F. The city averages 70 days above 95°F, with projections reaching 90–110 days by 2050. Neighborhoods in South Sacramento, North Highlands, and Del Paso Heights experience the most severe heat, with surface temperatures exceeding cooler areas by 15–20°F due to limited tree canopy and high impervious cover. Heat-related ER visits in Sacramento County have tripled since 2015.

### Wildfire Smoke

While Sacramento itself is not in the wildland-urban interface, it sits in a valley surrounded by fire-prone forests. The Camp Fire (2018), Dixie Fire (2021), and Mosquito Fire (2022) all sent thick smoke into the Sacramento Valley. PM2.5 levels during the 2020 fire season exceeded 400 µg/m³—more than 25 times the WHO guideline. Air quality impacts extend beyond acute health effects to economic losses from outdoor work stoppages, agricultural damage, and tourism decline.

## Local Climate Action

Sacramento's Climate Action Plan (2012, updated 2024) targets carbon neutrality by 2045 in alignment with state law. The city has committed to 100% renewable electricity through its municipal utility, SMUD (Sacramento Municipal Utility District), which targets zero-carbon electricity by 2030—the most ambitious timeline of any large utility in California.

SMUD's pathway includes 4,000 MW of solar, 2,000 MW of battery storage, and retirement of its last gas-fired power plant by 2030. The utility's building electrification incentives are among the most generous in the state, providing up to $13,750 for residential panel upgrades and heat pump installations.

Sacramento's Tree Foundation initiative aims to plant 5 million trees in the region by 2025 (the "Sacramento Tree Foundation 5 Million Tree Initiative"), targeting heat-burdened neighborhoods. The city's updated General Plan (2024) restricts new development in the highest-risk flood zones and requires climate resilience assessments for major projects.

## Regulations & Incentives

California's statewide mandates—AB 1279 net-zero by 2045, Title 24 building codes, cap-and-trade—apply fully. Sacramento's local regulations add flood-specific requirements: the city's floodplain management ordinance requires 1.5 feet of freeboard and restricts certain uses in the 200-year floodplain (a stricter standard than the federal 100-year requirement).

SMUD's incentives are exceptional: up to $3,000 for heat pump HVAC, $2,500 for heat pump water heater, $2,000 for panel upgrade, plus commercial programs covering up to 50% of efficiency retrofit costs. These stack with IRA federal incentives for substantial savings.

Sacramento's Commercial PACE program finances energy efficiency, solar, and resilience upgrades. California's SGIP program provides battery storage rebates up to $1,000/kWh, with enhanced incentives for low-income and medically vulnerable households.

## Federal Funding Opportunities

Sacramento's flood risk has attracted major federal investment. The Army Corps' American River Common Features Project ($1.8 billion) is upgrading 72 miles of levees protecting the Sacramento metro. SAFCA leverages local assessments with federal cost-share to accelerate levee improvements.

FEMA BRIC awarded California $89 million in 2023—the nation's largest allocation. Sacramento-area flood mitigation and levee improvement projects compete strongly. The National Flood Insurance Program's Community Rating System rewards Sacramento's floodplain management with premium discounts.

IRA incentives stack with SMUD programs: HEEHRA rebates plus SMUD rebates can cover 80–100% of residential electrification costs for income-qualified households. EPA Greenhouse Gas Reduction Fund awards support clean energy financing. DOT PROTECT funds climate-resilient transportation infrastructure.

## How Council Fire Can Help

Sacramento's combination of catastrophic flood risk, extreme heat, and energy transition opportunity creates a complex landscape that Council Fire is built to navigate. We help municipal agencies, utilities, developers, and homeowners align resilience investments with the funding and incentives available.

For SAFCA and municipal flood management agencies, Council Fire provides Army Corps coordination, benefit-cost analysis, and federal funding strategy for levee and floodplain projects. For building owners, we optimize the powerful stack of SMUD and IRA incentives to minimize electrification costs.

Our heat resilience practice supports urban forestry planning, cool roof and pavement deployment, and cooling center design. Council Fire brings the cross-hazard expertise that Sacramento's compound risks demand—connecting flood, heat, smoke, and energy into integrated resilience strategies.

## Frequently Asked Questions

### What are the biggest climate risks facing Sacramento?

Catastrophic flooding from levee failure during major storms is Sacramento's most severe risk—100,000 structures sit behind levees that may not withstand an ARkStorm event. Extreme heat is a growing killer, with 70+ days above 95°F and strong disparities across neighborhoods. Wildfire smoke from regional fires degrades air quality for weeks each summer.

### Does Sacramento have a climate action plan?

Yes. Sacramento targets carbon neutrality by 2045. SMUD, the municipal utility, aims for zero-carbon electricity by 2030 through massive solar, storage, and electrification investment. The city's updated General Plan restricts development in high-risk flood zones. The Sacramento Tree Foundation initiative targets 5 million trees to reduce heat.

### What federal funding is available for climate resilience in California?

California received $89 million in FEMA BRIC funding in 2023. The Army Corps' $1.8 billion American River Common Features Project is upgrading Sacramento's levees. IRA incentives stack with SMUD programs. EPA, NOAA, and DOT programs provide additional resilience funding.
