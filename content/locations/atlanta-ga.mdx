## Climate Snapshot

Atlanta is home to roughly 500,000 residents within city limits and over 6 million across the metro area, making it the economic and cultural hub of the Southeast. The city sits on the Piedmont Plateau at an elevation of around 1,050 feet—unusually high for a major Southern city—which spares it from hurricane storm surge but not from the intense rainfall, severe thunderstorms, and extreme heat that define the region's shifting climate.

On March 25, 2021, an EF-1 tornado tore through Newnan, southwest of Atlanta, killing one person and causing $50 million in damages. In September 2024, the remnants of Hurricane Helene brought sustained winds and heavy rain to metro Atlanta, toppling thousands of trees and leaving 1.2 million Georgia Power customers without electricity—the largest outage event in the utility's history. Flooding along Peachtree Creek and the Chattahoochee River corridor regularly impacts neighborhoods in northwest Atlanta, with repeated events in Underwood Hills, Bolton, and Whittier Mill.

Atlanta's average temperature has risen 2.5°F since 1970, and the city now experiences roughly 80 days per year above 90°F. The urban heat island effect pushes temperatures in downtown and south Atlanta neighborhoods 8-12°F higher than in the northern suburbs. Climate projections from Georgia Tech indicate the metro could see 100+ days above 90°F annually by 2060.

## Top Climate Risks

### Extreme Heat
Atlanta's combination of Southern latitude, rapid urbanization, and limited tree canopy in underserved neighborhoods makes heat a top-tier risk. South Atlanta, Bankhead, and neighborhoods along the I-20 corridor have canopy cover below 20%, compared to 55%+ in Buckhead and Druid Hills. Heat-related emergency room visits in Fulton County increased 40% between 2015 and 2023. The city's Extreme Heat Preparedness Report estimates economic losses from heat-related productivity declines at $370 million annually.

### Inland Flooding
Despite being 250 miles from the coast, Atlanta faces significant flood risk from intense rainfall and aging stormwater infrastructure. The city's network of creeks—Peachtree, Proctor, Utoy, and South River—flash-flood rapidly during heavy downpours. The September 2009 floods killed 10 people across metro Atlanta and caused $500 million in damages. Atlanta's Department of Watershed Management has identified over $2 billion in needed improvements to stormwater and sewer systems.

### Severe Storms and Tornadoes
Metro Atlanta sits in what meteorologists call "Dixie Alley," where warm Gulf moisture collides with cool fronts to produce severe thunderstorms and tornadoes. The March 2008 EF-2 tornado struck downtown Atlanta directly, damaging the Georgia Dome, CNN Center, and hundreds of structures. Annual severe storm damage in the metro averages $150 million over the past decade. Climate models suggest severe convective storms will become more frequent as temperatures rise.

## Local Climate Action

Atlanta's 2015 Climate Action Plan set a target of 40% greenhouse gas reduction below 2009 levels by 2030, with a long-term goal of carbon neutrality by 2050. Mayor Andre Dickens' administration has expanded this work through the One Atlanta: Resilience Strategy, which integrates climate adaptation, equity, and economic mobility.

The city committed to 100% clean energy for municipal operations by 2035 through a partnership with Georgia Power and renewable energy procurement. Atlanta's Commercial Buildings Energy Efficiency Ordinance, adopted in 2017, requires benchmarking and disclosure for buildings over 25,000 square feet.

The Atlanta BeltLine—a 22-mile loop of trails, parks, and transit corridors along former rail lines—serves as both a transportation and green infrastructure project, adding 1,300 acres of new park space and connecting 45 neighborhoods. The city has also committed to planting 75,000 new trees by 2030 through the Urban Tree Canopy initiative.

## Regulations & Incentives

Georgia's building codes generally follow the International Energy Conservation Code (IECC), though enforcement varies by jurisdiction. Atlanta adopted the 2021 IECC with local amendments. The city's Green Building Ordinance requires LEED certification for all new city-funded buildings.

Georgia Power offers rebates of $250-$500 for heat pump installations, $100 for smart thermostats, and demand-response incentives of $20-$50 monthly during peak periods. The state's solar tax credit was eliminated in 2015, but the federal Investment Tax Credit (30% through the IRA) remains available. Atlanta's Property Assessed Clean Energy (PACE) program allows commercial property owners to finance energy efficiency and renewable energy improvements through property tax assessments.

The Georgia Environmental Finance Authority (GEFA) provides low-interest loans for water infrastructure, energy efficiency, and land conservation projects.

## Federal Funding Opportunities

The IRA allocates Georgia approximately $134 million through the Home Electrification and Appliance Rebates program. Individual households can access up to $14,000 for heat pumps, electrical panel upgrades, insulation, and efficient appliances. The Home Efficiency Rebates program adds up to $8,000 per household.

FEMA's BRIC program awarded Georgia $22.6 million in 2023, with eligible projects including flood mitigation, stormwater infrastructure, and urban heat island reduction. The Hazard Mitigation Grant Program provides 75% federal cost share for post-disaster mitigation projects.

The EPA's Clean Water State Revolving Fund provides Georgia with approximately $60 million annually for water infrastructure improvements. HUD's CDBG program allocates roughly $35 million to Atlanta annually, and the DOT's RAISE grants have funded several BeltLine-related transportation resilience projects.

## How Council Fire Can Help

Council Fire supports Southeast communities at the intersection of rapid growth and increasing climate risk. In Atlanta, our team helps city agencies, nonprofits, and developers navigate the complex landscape of federal funding, state regulations, and local policy to deliver resilience outcomes. We specialize in vulnerability assessments for critical infrastructure, green infrastructure design for flood-prone watersheds, and community engagement strategies that center environmental justice.

From supporting the city's Urban Tree Canopy expansion to advising on stormwater infrastructure investments in South Atlanta, Council Fire brings the technical depth and grant management experience to accelerate Atlanta's climate resilience work.

## Frequently Asked Questions

### What are the biggest climate risks facing Atlanta?
Extreme heat is Atlanta's most pervasive climate risk, with south-side neighborhoods experiencing temperatures 8-12°F above cooler, tree-canopied areas. Inland flooding from intense rainfall regularly impacts communities along Peachtree Creek and the South River corridor. Severe storms and tornadoes are an ongoing threat—Hurricane Helene's remnants left 1.2 million without power in September 2024. All three risks hit hardest in low-income communities and communities of color.

### Does Atlanta have a climate action plan?
Yes. Atlanta's Climate Action Plan targets 40% greenhouse gas reduction by 2030 and carbon neutrality by 2050. The One Atlanta Resilience Strategy integrates climate with equity and economic development. Key initiatives include the 22-mile BeltLine corridor, a 75,000-tree planting commitment by 2030, mandatory energy benchmarking for commercial buildings, and a 100% clean energy target for city operations by 2035.

### What federal funding is available for climate resilience in Georgia?
Georgia has access to $134 million in IRA home electrification rebates, $22.6 million from FEMA BRIC (2023), and approximately $60 million annually through the Clean Water State Revolving Fund. Additional funding comes through HUD CDBG ($35 million to Atlanta annually), USDA rural development grants, and DOT RAISE grants for transportation resilience projects.

### How does the Atlanta BeltLine contribute to climate resilience?
The BeltLine adds 1,300 acres of green space that absorbs stormwater, reduces the urban heat island effect, and provides car-free transportation options. The trail system connects 45 neighborhoods and integrates bioswales, rain gardens, and native plantings that manage runoff. It also supports transit-oriented development that reduces vehicle miles traveled and associated emissions.
