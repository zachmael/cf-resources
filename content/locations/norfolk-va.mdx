## Climate Snapshot

Norfolk, Virginia, population approximately 235,000, sits on the western shore of the Chesapeake Bay at the mouth of the Elizabeth River. The city is the hub of the Hampton Roads metropolitan area and home to the world's largest naval base, Naval Station Norfolk. With an average elevation of just 7 feet above sea level and over 144 miles of shoreline, Norfolk is among the most flood-vulnerable cities in the United States.

The numbers are stark. Norfolk experiences tidal flooding roughly 10–12 times per year—up from 1.5 days annually in the 1960s. Sea levels in the Hampton Roads region have risen 18 inches since 1930, driven by both global sea-level rise and regional land subsidence of 1–3 millimeters per year. Hurricane Matthew in 2016 caused $50 million in damages across the city. In September 2024, a stalled coastal low brought 8 inches of rain in 12 hours, flooding hundreds of homes in the Larchmont-Edgewater and Ghent neighborhoods.

The consequences extend beyond property. Norfolk's economy depends on military installations, the Port of Virginia, and tourism—all coastal assets. Chronic flooding disrupts daily commutes, suppresses property values in low-lying neighborhoods, and strains city budgets already stretched thin by repetitive loss claims.

## Top Climate Risks

### Sea-Level Rise and Tidal Flooding

NOAA projects 1.5–3.5 feet of additional sea-level rise in Hampton Roads by 2060 under intermediate-to-high scenarios. Combined with land subsidence, this makes Norfolk one of the fastest-sinking cities on the East Coast. Roughly 5,400 structures sit in the current 100-year floodplain, with an assessed value exceeding $3.2 billion. Sunny-day tidal flooding already renders some streets in the Hague and Ocean View neighborhoods impassable during king tides.

### Hurricanes and Storm Surge

Norfolk's geography—low-lying land funneling into the Chesapeake Bay—amplifies storm surge. A Category 2 hurricane making landfall near the Bay mouth could generate 8–12 feet of surge in downtown Norfolk. The 2003 Hurricane Isabel produced a 7.9-foot surge, flooding Naval Station Norfolk and causing $140 million in damages across Hampton Roads. Climate models suggest a 20–30% increase in the intensity of the strongest Atlantic hurricanes by 2060.

### Extreme Precipitation

Heavy rainfall events in the Mid-Atlantic have increased 55% since 1958. Norfolk's flat topography and aging stormwater system—much of it gravity-fed and designed for 1970s rainfall assumptions—cannot handle modern downpours. The city's combined challenges of tidal flooding and interior drainage mean that even moderate storms can produce widespread street and basement flooding.

## Local Climate Action

Norfolk adopted its Coastal Resilience Strategy in 2015, one of the first comprehensive resilience plans by a mid-size U.S. city. Updated as "Norfolk Vision 2100," the plan takes an 80-year view, organizing the city into zones prioritized for protection, adaptation, or managed retreat. The city has committed $155 million in resilience-related capital projects through 2030.

Key initiatives include the Ohio Creek Watershed Project ($115 million, funded jointly by HUD and the city), which combines green infrastructure, tidal barriers, and neighborhood redesign in the Chesterfield Heights and Granby Park areas. The Ghent Stormwater Project ($27 million) is upgrading drainage capacity to handle 10-year storm events.

Norfolk has also established a Chief Resilience Officer position, joined the 100 Resilient Cities network (now Global Resilient Cities Network), and requires sea-level rise impact assessments for all major development applications.

## Regulations & Incentives

Virginia's Clean Economy Act (2020) mandates 100% carbon-free electricity by 2045 and establishes an energy efficiency resource standard. The state joined the Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative (RGGI) in 2021 (though participation has faced political challenges), creating a carbon pricing mechanism that generates revenue for flood resilience and clean energy programs.

Norfolk's zoning code includes a Coastal Resilience Overlay District that requires new construction in flood-prone areas to meet elevated freeboard standards (3 feet above base flood elevation). The city offers stormwater fee credits of up to 50% for properties that install rain gardens, permeable pavement, or other green infrastructure.

Virginia's Property Assessed Clean Energy (C-PACE) program enables commercial building owners to finance energy efficiency and resilience upgrades. The state's solar tax exemption and net metering policies support distributed renewable energy deployment.

## Federal Funding Opportunities

Hampton Roads has been a major recipient of federal resilience funding. The HUD National Disaster Resilience Competition awarded Norfolk $115 million for the Ohio Creek Watershed Project. FEMA's BRIC program has provided over $12 million to Norfolk and surrounding jurisdictions for flood mitigation since 2020.

The Army Corps of Engineers' Norfolk Coastal Storm Risk Management Study (authorized in the 2022 WRDA at $400 million) is evaluating large-scale flood protection measures, including surge barriers, seawalls, and nature-based solutions for the Hampton Roads region.

IRA funding provides up to $14,000 per household for electrification upgrades through HEEHRA, with enhanced rebates for low-income households. The DOT PROTECT program allocates formula funding to Virginia for climate-resilient transportation infrastructure, directly relevant to Norfolk's flood-prone road network.

The DOD's Defense Community Infrastructure Program (DCIP) also channels funding to Norfolk given the military's $3 billion in at-risk coastal assets in the region.

## How Council Fire Can Help

Norfolk's challenge is existential—the city must adapt or face managed retreat across significant portions of its footprint. Council Fire works with municipal leaders, military installation planners, developers, and property owners to turn resilience strategies into funded, executed projects.

We specialize in federal grant applications for BRIC, FMA, and Army Corps programs, helping Norfolk-area clients build competitive proposals backed by robust benefit-cost analyses. For developers navigating the Coastal Resilience Overlay District, we provide site-specific risk assessments and design guidance that meets or exceeds local standards.

Council Fire also supports the military community's resilience needs, helping installations and surrounding communities align climate adaptation plans with DOD's Installation Resilience framework. From stormwater management to building electrification, we bring the technical capacity that Norfolk's accelerating timeline demands.

## Frequently Asked Questions

### What are the biggest climate risks facing Norfolk?

Sea-level rise and tidal flooding are Norfolk's defining challenge. The city has experienced 18 inches of relative sea-level rise since 1930, and another 1.5–3.5 feet is projected by 2060. Combined with land subsidence, hurricanes, and intensifying rainfall, Norfolk faces chronic flooding that threatens homes, infrastructure, military installations, and economic vitality.

### Does Norfolk have a climate action plan?

Yes. Norfolk's Vision 2100 Coastal Resilience Strategy takes an 80-year approach, organizing the city into protection, adaptation, and transition zones. The city has committed $155 million in resilience capital projects and completed landmark initiatives like the $115 million Ohio Creek Watershed Project. A Chief Resilience Officer coordinates citywide efforts.

### What federal funding is available for climate resilience in Virginia?

Virginia benefits from FEMA BRIC and FMA grants, Army Corps coastal storm risk management studies (including a $400 million authorized study for Hampton Roads), HUD resilience competitions, IRA electrification and renewable energy incentives, DOT PROTECT formula funding, and DOD community infrastructure programs given the significant military presence along the coast.

### Is Norfolk experiencing managed retreat?

Norfolk's Vision 2100 plan does include transition zones where the city may not invest in long-term flood protection and instead support voluntary buyouts and relocation. However, most of the city falls within protection and adaptation zones where significant public investment is planned. The approach is phased over decades, not immediate displacement.
