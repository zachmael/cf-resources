## Climate Snapshot

Pensacola sits on Escambia Bay in Florida's western Panhandle, roughly 15 miles from the Gulf of Mexico. The city has absorbed direct hits from multiple major hurricanes in the past two decades—Ivan (2004), Dennis (2005), and Sally (2020)—each causing billions in regional damage. Hurricane Sally's stall over the area produced 30+ inches of rain and 6 feet of storm surge, destroying the newly rebuilt Three Mile Bridge and flooding thousands of structures.

The Pensacola metro has warmed approximately 1.8°F since 1970, and annual precipitation has increased by roughly 10%, with a disproportionate share falling in intense, short-duration events. The Pensacola Bay tide gauge shows about 10 inches of sea level rise over the past 60 years, and NOAA's intermediate projections suggest an additional 1 to 2.5 feet by 2060.

Escambia County's population grew 8% between 2010 and 2023, reaching approximately 330,000. Naval Air Station Pensacola, the region's largest employer, faces its own climate adaptation challenges—the Department of Defense has identified it as a high-risk installation for sea level rise and extreme weather.

## Top Climate Risks

### Hurricane Wind & Storm Surge

Pensacola lies in FEMA's Wind Zone IV, with design wind speeds of 150 mph. Storm surge is the primary life-safety threat: NOAA's SLOSH models show 12–18 feet of surge possible from a Category 4 storm in Escambia Bay. Hurricane Ivan's surge reached 12 feet in some Pensacola Beach locations. The Pensacola Bay Bridge—the only east-west crossing—has been destroyed or severely damaged by two storms since 2004, isolating Gulf Breeze and Pensacola Beach.

### Chronic Flooding & Stormwater Failure

Downtown Pensacola and the Tanyard, Brownsville, and Ensley neighborhoods experience repeated flooding from rainfall events as modest as 4 inches. The city's stormwater system was largely built in the 1960s and designed for a 10-year storm; it now regularly fails during 2-year events. Carpenter Creek and Bayou Texar flood dozens of homes annually. FEMA repetitive-loss data shows over 800 properties in Escambia County have filed two or more flood claims.

### Extreme Heat

Pensacola averages 80 days per year above 90°F, projected to reach 100–120 days by 2050 under moderate emissions scenarios. Heat index values frequently exceed 110°F during summer. Heat-related emergency room visits in Escambia County increased 35% between 2015 and 2023. The urban heat island effect amplifies temperatures in downtown Pensacola by 3–5°F compared to surrounding areas.

## Local Climate Action

Escambia County updated its Local Mitigation Strategy (LMS) in 2024, integrating sea level rise projections and updated flood modeling into the plan for the first time. The LMS identifies $280 million in priority mitigation projects, including Carpenter Creek watershed improvements, critical facility hardening, and community safe rooms.

The City of Pensacola adopted a Stormwater Master Plan in 2023 targeting $150 million in drainage improvements over 15 years. Phase 1 projects, funded through a stormwater utility fee increase, focus on the Tanyard and downtown watersheds. The plan incorporates green infrastructure standards including bioswales, rain gardens, and permeable pavement.

The Pensacola and Perdido Bays Estuary Program coordinates regional conservation and restoration, including oyster reef restoration, seagrass monitoring, and watershed management plans that double as flood mitigation.

## Regulations & Incentives

Florida Building Code (7th Edition, 2023) applies statewide and includes some of the nation's strictest wind-resistance requirements. Escambia County enforces a 1-foot freeboard above BFE and requires wind-borne debris protection for all structures within the wind-borne debris region.

Florida's Property Assessed Clean Energy (PACE) program allows commercial and residential property owners to finance wind hardening, flood mitigation, and energy efficiency improvements through property tax assessments. The state's Sales Tax Exemption for solar energy systems remains in effect, and the My Safe Florida Home program provides up to $10,000 in matching grants for residential wind mitigation.

Florida Power & Light and Gulf Power (now NextEra) offer commercial and residential rebates for high-efficiency HVAC, insulation, and smart thermostats.

## Federal Funding Opportunities

FEMA's Hazard Mitigation Grant Program (HMGP) is activated after each presidential disaster declaration. Following Hurricane Sally, Escambia County received over $40 million in HMGP funding for property acquisition, elevation, and infrastructure hardening.

The USDA's Emergency Watershed Protection Program has funded sediment removal and channel restoration in Carpenter Creek and its tributaries, with projects totaling $8 million since 2020.

The Department of Defense's Defense Community Infrastructure Program (DCIP) provides grants to communities adjacent to military installations for infrastructure resilience. NAS Pensacola's climate exposure makes Escambia County a strong candidate.

EPA's Water Infrastructure Finance and Innovation Act (WIFIA) program offers low-interest loans for large stormwater and water infrastructure projects, with loans starting at $20 million.

## How Council Fire Can Help

Council Fire partners with Panhandle communities on the full resilience lifecycle—from hazard mitigation plan development through post-disaster recovery. We've supported Gulf Coast clients with HMGP and BRIC applications, stormwater master planning, and nature-based solution design.

Our federal funding expertise helps municipalities and counties navigate the complex landscape of FEMA, HUD, EPA, and DOD resilience programs. For NAS Pensacola and the surrounding community, we bring experience in military-community resilience partnerships and DCIP grant strategy. Our sustainability practice supports private developers and commercial property owners with green building certification, energy benchmarking, and climate risk disclosure.

## Frequently Asked Questions

### How often does Pensacola get hit by hurricanes?

Pensacola has been directly affected by a tropical storm or hurricane roughly every 3–4 years over the past two decades. Since 2004, the city has experienced three major hurricane landfalls (Ivan, Dennis, Sally) and several tropical storm impacts. NOAA climatology data shows the western Florida Panhandle has the highest hurricane landfall frequency of any segment of the U.S. coastline.

### What is the My Safe Florida Home program?

My Safe Florida Home provides free wind inspections and matching grants of up to $10,000 for residential wind hardening improvements, including roof-to-wall connections, hurricane shutters, impact-resistant windows, and roof deck attachment upgrades. Eligibility is based on home value, insurance status, and homestead exemption. The program is funded by the Florida Legislature and administered by the Department of Financial Services.

### Are there buyout programs for repeatedly flooded properties?

Yes. FEMA's HMGP and Flood Mitigation Assistance (FMA) programs fund voluntary acquisition (buyout) of repetitive-loss and severe repetitive-loss properties. Escambia County has completed over 100 buyouts since 2005, converting flood-prone lots to permanent open space. Property owners receive pre-flood fair market value. Applications are managed through the county's Floodplain Management office.

### How is climate change affecting Pensacola Bay?

Water temperatures in Pensacola Bay have risen approximately 2°F since the 1990s, contributing to shifts in fish species composition and increasing vulnerability to harmful algal blooms. Sea level rise is accelerating saltwater intrusion into coastal wetlands and low-lying neighborhoods. Seagrass coverage has declined in areas affected by increased turbidity from more intense rainfall and runoff.
