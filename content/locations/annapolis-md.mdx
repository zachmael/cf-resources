## Climate Snapshot

Annapolis, Maryland's capital city with a population of roughly 40,000, sits at the confluence of the Severn River and the Chesapeake Bay. Its low-lying historic downtown — much of it less than five feet above mean high tide — makes it one of the most flood-vulnerable small cities on the East Coast. The city's economy depends heavily on maritime tourism, the U.S. Naval Academy, and state government, all of which face direct exposure to rising waters.

Tidal flooding in Annapolis has increased more than 900% since the 1960s. City Dock, the heart of the historic district, now floods dozens of times per year during routine high tides — no storm required. Hurricane Isabel in September 2003 pushed a 7.5-foot storm surge into the city, causing over $100 million in damages across the region. More recently, nor'easters in October 2021 and January 2024 inundated downtown streets and forced temporary business closures.

The Chesapeake Bay, the nation's largest estuary, is warming faster than the global ocean average. Combined with land subsidence of roughly 1–2 mm per year, Annapolis faces effective sea level rise rates nearly double the global mean. NOAA projects an additional 1.5 to 3.5 feet of rise by 2060 under intermediate-to-high scenarios, threatening roughly 30% of the city's historic core.

## Top Climate Risks

### Sea Level Rise & Tidal Flooding

FEMA rates Annapolis among the highest flood-risk communities in Maryland. The city experiences "sunny day" tidal flooding more than 50 times annually, a number projected to exceed 100 days per year by 2040. The NOAA tide gauge at Annapolis (Station 8575512) has recorded a long-term sea level rise trend of 3.71 mm/year — roughly one foot per century before accounting for accelerating ice melt. The City Dock area, Eastport, and sections of West Street regularly see water in streets and businesses during king tides and minor coastal storms.

### Storm Surge & Hurricanes

Chesapeake Bay's funnel shape amplifies storm surge from tropical systems tracking up the Atlantic seaboard. Hurricane Isabel (2003) remains the benchmark event, but modeling from the Army Corps of Engineers suggests a Category 2 hurricane making landfall south of the Bay could generate 10–12 feet of surge at Annapolis. The city's critical infrastructure — including the wastewater treatment plant on the Back Creek peninsula — sits within the 100-year floodplain.

### Extreme Heat & Precipitation

Maryland's average temperature has risen 1.5°F since 1900. Heat waves are intensifying, with Annapolis recording 15+ days above 95°F in the summers of 2023 and 2024. Extreme precipitation events have increased 55% in the Northeast since 1958 (National Climate Assessment, 2023), overwhelming the city's aging stormwater infrastructure and compounding tidal flooding.

## Local Climate Action

The City of Annapolis adopted its first comprehensive Climate Action Plan in 2020, targeting a 60% reduction in community-wide greenhouse gas emissions by 2030 relative to a 2006 baseline. Key initiatives include electrification of the city vehicle fleet, a green building incentive program, and expansion of the urban tree canopy by 10% by 2035.

The Resilience Authority of Annapolis and Anne Arundel County, established in 2020 as one of the nation's first local resilience financing authorities, is central to implementation. The Authority is empowered to issue bonds, accept grants, and finance infrastructure projects specifically designed to reduce flood risk and improve climate resilience. Its flagship project, the City Dock Resilience Plan, involves raising City Dock by approximately three feet, installing living shorelines, and creating a deployable flood barrier system — a $50 million investment currently in design.

Maryland's Climate Solutions Now Act of 2022 requires a 60% statewide GHG reduction by 2031 and net-zero by 2045, providing a strong policy tailwind for local action. The state's Commission on Climate Change publishes annual progress reports that inform Annapolis's planning priorities.

## Regulations & Incentives

Maryland's Building Performance Standards (2024) require large commercial buildings to achieve net-zero direct emissions by 2040. The state's Renewable Portfolio Standard mandates 50% renewable electricity by 2030. Annapolis enforces enhanced stormwater management requirements for new development and substantial renovations in the floodplain.

The Maryland Energy Administration offers Commercial Clean Energy Grants up to $250,000 for solar, geothermal, and energy storage projects. The EmPOWER Maryland program provides rebates for energy efficiency upgrades in residential and commercial buildings. Anne Arundel County's Green Building Tax Credit offers a 10-year property tax credit for LEED-certified buildings.

Federal tax credits under the Inflation Reduction Act — including the 30% Investment Tax Credit for solar and the 179D deduction for energy-efficient commercial buildings — apply statewide and can be stacked with Maryland incentives.

## Federal Funding Opportunities

The FEMA Building Resilient Infrastructure and Communities (BRIC) program allocated $1 billion nationally in FY2024, with Maryland communities among the top applicants. Annapolis and Anne Arundel County have received BRIC funding for flood mitigation planning in prior cycles.

The Inflation Reduction Act directs $3 billion to the EPA's Environmental and Climate Justice Block Grants and $27 billion to the Greenhouse Gas Reduction Fund, both of which Annapolis-area organizations are eligible to access. The Army Corps of Engineers' ongoing Chesapeake Bay Comprehensive Plan includes funding authorization for shoreline protection and living shoreline projects in the Annapolis area.

NOAA's Climate-Ready Coasts initiative and the National Coastal Resilience Fund (administered by NFWF) have supported Chesapeake Bay projects ranging from $500,000 to $5 million. The Bipartisan Infrastructure Law provides an additional $3.5 billion nationally for FEMA flood mitigation assistance through 2026.
