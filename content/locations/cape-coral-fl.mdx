## Climate Snapshot

Cape Coral is a sprawling planned community of 215,000 residents on the Caloosahatchee River in Lee County, Southwest Florida. The city is defined by its 400+ miles of navigable canals—more than any other city in the world—which were dredged from mangrove swamps and tidal flats beginning in the 1950s. This canal system, originally a real estate marketing feature, now functions as both the city's stormwater infrastructure and its primary flood risk vector.

Hurricane Ian made landfall on September 28, 2022, as a Category 4 storm on nearby Cayo Costa, devastating Cape Coral with 150 mph winds and 6–8 feet of storm surge that pushed through the canal system into inland neighborhoods. The storm caused over $110 billion in total regional damage—making it the costliest Florida hurricane in history. Over 30,000 Cape Coral structures sustained damage.

Lee County's population grew 26% between 2010 and 2023, making it one of the fastest-growing metros in the U.S. Much of that growth occurred in flood-vulnerable areas. The combination of rapid development, canal-dependent drainage, and escalating hurricane risk creates an acute resilience challenge that Ian's devastation made impossible to ignore.

## Top Climate Risks

### Hurricane & Storm Surge

Cape Coral's canal system amplifies storm surge by channeling Gulf waters deep into the city's interior. During Ian, surge traveled 3–5 miles inland through canals, flooding neighborhoods that had never flooded before. NOAA SLOSH models show 8–12 feet of surge possible from a direct Category 4 hit—and Ian's track was slightly south of worst-case for Cape Coral. A storm on a more northerly track could produce even higher surge in the Caloosahatchee estuary.

### Sea Level Rise & Canal System Vulnerability

Sea level at Fort Myers has risen approximately 10 inches over the past 50 years. The city's canal system, with weirs and spreader canals designed for mid-20th-century sea levels, is losing drainage capacity as tidal baselines rise. Many canal-front lots have elevations of 3–5 feet—well within the reach of projected sea level rise. By 2060, daily high tides could approach levels that currently cause nuisance flooding.

### Water Quality & Red Tide

The Caloosahatchee River receives nutrient-laden discharges from Lake Okeechobee, contributing to harmful algal blooms including toxic blue-green algae in the river and red tide (Karenia brevis) in the Gulf. Warmer water temperatures are extending bloom seasons and increasing intensity. Red tide events have killed marine life, closed beaches, caused respiratory irritation, and damaged the tourism economy. The 2018 bloom lasted over a year and caused an estimated $8 billion in economic damage across Southwest Florida.

## Local Climate Action

In the wake of Hurricane Ian, Cape Coral fast-tracked its Resilience and Recovery Plan (2023), identifying $1.2 billion in infrastructure needs including canal system modernization, pump station construction, and elevated roadways. The plan recommends updating the canal system's weir elevations and installing backflow prevention to reduce surge intrusion.

The city adopted a post-Ian building ordinance requiring all new construction and substantial improvements in the SFHA to be elevated to BFE plus 3 feet of freeboard—a significant increase from the previous 1-foot standard. The city also enacted a revised critical facilities ordinance requiring BFE plus 4 feet.

Lee County's Climate Adaptation Plan (2024) addresses county-wide resilience, including regional stormwater management, evacuation route hardening, and nature-based solutions along the Caloosahatchee and Estero Bay estuaries.

## Regulations & Incentives

Cape Coral's post-Ian freeboard ordinance (BFE + 3 feet) is among the most protective in Florida. The Florida Building Code's 7th Edition (2023) wind-speed provisions require design for 160 mph in Lee County. The 50% substantial damage rule means that Ian-damaged structures requiring major repairs must be brought up to current code, including elevation standards.

Florida's My Safe Florida Home program provides up to $10,000 in matching grants for residential wind hardening. PACE financing is available for commercial and residential resilience improvements, solar, and energy efficiency.

The South Florida Water Management District (SFWMD) regulates water use and discharge in the Caloosahatchee basin, with implications for development permitting and stormwater management in Cape Coral.

## Federal Funding Opportunities

FEMA's HMGP, activated by Hurricane Ian's presidential disaster declaration, is providing over $600 million to Florida for hazard mitigation, with Lee County among the top recipients. Projects include property elevation, acquisition, and infrastructure hardening.

HUD allocated $3.3 billion in CDBG-DR funding for Hurricane Ian recovery in Florida, with Lee County receiving a significant share for housing rehabilitation, infrastructure restoration, and resilience upgrades. The CDBG-DR action plan prioritizes low- and moderate-income households.

The Army Corps of Engineers' Caloosahatchee River (C-43) West Basin Storage Reservoir project ($800 million) will reduce harmful discharges to the Caloosahatchee and improve water quality, with completion expected by 2028.

NOAA's NFWF National Coastal Resilience Fund supports mangrove restoration and living shoreline projects along the Lee County coast.

## How Council Fire Can Help

Council Fire has mobilized Gulf Coast resilience expertise for Cape Coral and Lee County clients in the wake of Hurricane Ian. We support municipal recovery and resilience planning, FEMA HMGP and CDBG-DR program administration, and long-term infrastructure adaptation strategy.

Our team helps developers and builders navigate Cape Coral's new freeboard and code requirements, design hurricane-resilient structures, and access PACE financing. For commercial and hospitality clients, we provide climate risk assessment, business continuity planning, and ESG strategy that addresses the region's evolving risk landscape.

## Frequently Asked Questions

### How much damage did Hurricane Ian cause in Cape Coral?

Hurricane Ian (September 2022) caused over $110 billion in regional damage, making it the costliest Florida hurricane ever. In Cape Coral specifically, over 30,000 structures were damaged, with thousands rendered uninhabitable. Storm surge of 6–8 feet penetrated miles inland through the canal system. The city's recovery continues, with billions in federal assistance flowing through FEMA, HUD, and SBA programs.

### Why did areas far from the coast flood during Ian?

Cape Coral's 400+ miles of canals connect directly to the Caloosahatchee River and ultimately the Gulf of Mexico. During Ian, storm surge traveled through these canals like a highway, pushing water miles into the city's interior. Homes on canals that had never experienced flooding were inundated with 3–5 feet of surge-driven water. This canal-amplified surge effect is unique to Cape Coral's geography and is now a central focus of the city's resilience planning.

### What are the new building requirements after Ian?

Cape Coral now requires all new construction and substantial improvements in Special Flood Hazard Areas to be elevated to Base Flood Elevation plus 3 feet of freeboard (up from 1 foot pre-Ian). Critical facilities must meet BFE plus 4 feet. The Florida Building Code's 7th Edition requires design for 160 mph winds in Lee County. Properties that sustained damage exceeding 50% of pre-storm value must meet all current code requirements when rebuilt, including the new elevation standards.

### What is being done about red tide and water quality?

The Army Corps' C-43 West Basin Storage Reservoir ($800 million) will store and treat Lake Okeechobee discharges before they reach the Caloosahatchee, reducing nutrient loads that fuel algal blooms. The project is scheduled for completion in 2028. The state's Blue-Green Algae Task Force has recommended additional nutrient reduction strategies, and Lee County is investing in septic-to-sewer conversions and stormwater treatment to reduce local nutrient contributions.
