## Climate Snapshot

Raleigh, North Carolina's capital, is home to approximately 482,000 residents in the city proper and over 1.4 million in the metro area, making it one of the fastest-growing cities in the Southeast. Situated in the Piedmont region about 150 miles inland from the coast, Raleigh sits at the confluence of several creeks that feed the Neuse River basin, creating significant inland flood risk despite its distance from the ocean.

Hurricane Florence in September 2018 dumped over 10 inches of rain on the Raleigh metro area in 48 hours, causing widespread flooding along Crabtree Creek and the Neuse River. Damages across Wake County exceeded $100 million, with more than 500 homes flooded. In 2016, Hurricane Matthew caused similar devastation, with Crabtree Valley Mall—one of the state's largest shopping centers—taking on several feet of water for the second time in three years. These events underscored that Raleigh's flood risk is driven primarily by inland precipitation, not coastal storm surge.

Heat is an escalating concern. Raleigh recorded 51 days above 90°F in 2023, compared to a historical average of 35. The city's rapid development—Wake County added over 60,000 new residents between 2020 and 2024—is converting agricultural and forested land to impervious surfaces at a pace that worsens both stormwater runoff and urban heat island effects. Average temperatures in downtown Raleigh now run 4-7°F hotter than surrounding rural areas.

## Top Climate Risks

### Inland Flooding
Crabtree Creek, Walnut Creek, and their tributaries present persistent flood risk across Raleigh. FEMA's flood maps identify over 4,500 structures in the 100-year floodplain within Wake County. The Crabtree Creek watershed alone has experienced six major flood events since 2000, with cumulative damages exceeding $300 million. The city's 2020 Stormwater Master Plan estimated that upgrading drainage infrastructure to handle projected increases in extreme rainfall would cost $1.2 billion over 20 years. Climate models project a 20% increase in rainfall intensity during extreme events by 2060.

### Extreme Heat
Raleigh's summers are getting longer and hotter. Between 2000 and 2023, the number of heat advisory days issued by the National Weather Service for Wake County doubled. Heat-related hospitalizations in the Triangle region increased 38% between 2015 and 2023. Rapid suburbanization is removing tree canopy—Raleigh lost approximately 5,500 acres of tree cover between 2012 and 2021 according to a UNC Charlotte study—reducing natural cooling capacity precisely as temperatures climb.

### Severe Storms and Tornadoes
North Carolina ranks in the top 10 states for tornado frequency, and the Raleigh area sits in "Dixie Alley," an increasingly active zone for severe convective storms. The April 2011 tornado outbreak produced an EF-3 tornado that tracked through north Raleigh, killing 3 people and causing $100 million in damage. Derecho events and severe thunderstorms have also intensified, with a July 2023 storm producing 80 mph straight-line winds that knocked out power to 200,000 customers across the Triangle.

## Local Climate Action

Raleigh adopted its Community Climate Action Plan (CCAP) in 2021, setting a target of 80% reduction in community-wide greenhouse gas emissions by 2050 from a 2007 baseline. The plan's interim target calls for a 50% reduction by 2030, with progress tracked through biennial greenhouse gas inventories. As of the 2023 inventory, the city had achieved approximately 22% reduction.

The city's municipal operations target is carbon neutrality by 2040. Raleigh completed a 5 MW solar installation at the Neuse River Wastewater Treatment Plant in 2023 and committed to purchasing 100% renewable electricity for city buildings by 2028 through Duke Energy's Green Source Advantage program.

Raleigh's Urban Forest Master Plan (2022) targets planting 100,000 new trees by 2030 to combat urban heat island effects and improve stormwater absorption. The city's updated Unified Development Ordinance (2023) strengthened tree preservation requirements and increased pervious surface mandates for new commercial development.

## Regulations & Incentives

North Carolina's Clean Energy Plan (2019) set a goal of 70% carbon reduction from the power sector by 2030 and carbon neutrality by 2050. House Bill 951, passed in 2021, codified the 70% reduction target and directed the NC Utilities Commission to develop a carbon reduction plan with Duke Energy. The state requires net metering for solar installations up to 1 MW.

Raleigh's stormwater utility fee provides credits of up to 40% for properties implementing best management practices (BMPs) such as rain gardens, bioswales, and permeable surfaces. The city's Home Energy Upgrade program, launched in 2023, provides income-qualified residents with up to $5,000 in weatherization improvements.

Wake County's Green Building Incentive Program expedites permitting for projects meeting LEED Gold or higher standards, reducing review timelines by up to 30%. North Carolina's renewable energy tax credit expired in 2016 but federal IRA credits remain available, and Duke Energy's PowerPair rebate offers $3,000 for residential solar-plus-battery installations.

## Federal Funding Opportunities

The Inflation Reduction Act directs substantial resources to North Carolina. The state's allocation under the Home Energy Rebate Programs totals $262 million, providing up to $8,000 per household for heat pump installations and up to $14,000 for low-income households through HEEHR. The IRA's tax credits for residential solar (30%), battery storage (30%), and home energy efficiency improvements remain available through 2032.

FEMA's BRIC program has been a major funding source for Raleigh. The city received $14.2 million in BRIC funding in 2022 for Crabtree Creek flood mitigation, including property acquisitions and channel improvements. The national BRIC program allocates $1 billion annually, and Raleigh's repetitive loss properties along Crabtree Creek rank among the highest-priority acquisitions in the Southeast.

The EPA's Climate Pollution Reduction Grants provided the Triangle region with $3 million in planning funds, with implementation grants of up to $500 million available. USDA's Urban and Community Forestry grants align with Raleigh's tree-planting goals, with $1.5 billion allocated nationally through the IRA. HUD's CDBG program provides Wake County approximately $3.8 million annually, portions of which support flood mitigation and resilient housing.

## Frequently Asked Questions

### What are the biggest climate risks facing Raleigh?
Raleigh's top climate risks are inland flooding (six major flood events since 2000 with over $300 million in cumulative damages along Crabtree Creek alone), extreme heat (51 days above 90°F in 2023 versus a historical average of 35), and severe storms including tornadoes. Rapid population growth and land conversion are amplifying all three risks by increasing impervious surfaces and reducing tree canopy.

### Does Raleigh have a climate action plan?
Yes. Raleigh adopted its Community Climate Action Plan in 2021, targeting an 80% greenhouse gas reduction by 2050 and 50% by 2030 from a 2007 baseline. The city also aims for carbon-neutral municipal operations by 2040. Key initiatives include a 5 MW solar installation at the Neuse River treatment plant, a 100,000-tree planting program, and updated development codes requiring more pervious surfaces and tree preservation.

### What federal funding is available for climate resilience in North Carolina?
North Carolina communities can access IRA Home Energy Rebates ($262 million state allocation), FEMA BRIC grants (Raleigh received $14.2 million in 2022), EPA Climate Pollution Reduction Grants, and USDA Urban Forestry grants ($1.5 billion nationally). Federal tax credits cover 30% of residential solar and battery storage costs through 2032. Duke Energy's PowerPair program adds $3,000 for solar-plus-battery systems.

### How does Raleigh's growth affect climate resilience?
Wake County's rapid growth—60,000+ new residents between 2020 and 2024—converts forests and farmland to impervious surfaces, increasing stormwater runoff and flood risk while reducing natural cooling. Raleigh lost 5,500 acres of tree cover between 2012 and 2021. The city's updated development codes aim to mitigate these impacts, but infrastructure investment needs to keep pace with growth to prevent worsening flood and heat outcomes.
