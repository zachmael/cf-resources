## Climate Snapshot

Florida's 1,350 miles of coastline, 22 million residents, and average elevation of just 6 feet above sea level make it the most climate-exposed state in the nation. The state projects into warm Gulf and Atlantic waters that fuel hurricanes, and its flat, porous limestone geology—particularly in the southern half—makes conventional flood defenses difficult or impossible. Florida accounts for 35% of all National Flood Insurance Program policies in the United States.

The state has warmed approximately 2°F since the 1960s, with South Florida warming fastest. Sea levels along the Florida coast have risen 8–14 inches over the past century (varying by location and local factors), with the rate accelerating to roughly 1 inch every 3 years at the Virginia Key tide gauge. The Southeast Florida Regional Climate Change Compact projects 10 to 17 inches of additional rise by 2040 and 21 to 54 inches by 2060.

Florida's $1.4 trillion economy—driven by tourism, agriculture, real estate, defense, and increasingly technology—faces pervasive climate risk. The state processes over 140 million visitors annually, grows 70% of the nation's citrus, and contains over $3 trillion in insured coastal property. Every sector faces material climate exposure.

## Top Climate Risks

### Hurricanes & Storm Surge

Florida has been struck by more hurricanes than any other state—120 since 1851. Hurricane Ian (2022) caused $110 billion in damage, making it the costliest Florida hurricane ever. Hurricane Michael (2018) was the first Category 5 to strike the Panhandle. NOAA research shows that hurricane rapid intensification events—where storms gain 30+ mph in 24 hours—have become more frequent in the warming Gulf, reducing evacuation lead times.

### Sea Level Rise & Coastal Flooding

Florida's 6-foot average elevation and porous limestone bedrock make it uniquely vulnerable. In South Florida, rising seas push groundwater up through the rock, flooding from below regardless of seawalls. Over 2.4 million Floridians live within 4 feet of the local high-tide line. Tidal flooding has increased 300–400% at Florida tide gauges since 2000. At 3 feet of sea level rise, an estimated 1 million Florida homes would be at risk.

### Extreme Heat & Public Health

Florida averages 30–80 days above 90°F per year depending on location, with projections of 60–130 days by 2050. Wet-bulb temperatures—the combination of heat and humidity limiting the body's cooling—are approaching dangerous thresholds during summer months across the state. Heat-related worker injuries and illnesses cost Florida's economy an estimated $500 million annually, with agricultural and construction workers most affected.

## Local Climate Action

Florida's Statewide Flooding and Sea Level Rise Resilience Plan (2023), developed by the Office of Resilience and Coastal Protection, identifies priorities across infrastructure, natural systems, and community resilience. The Resilient Florida Grant Program provides $100 million annually for local government adaptation projects, with a focus on vulnerability assessments and infrastructure hardening.

The Southeast Florida Regional Climate Change Compact—comprising Broward, Miami-Dade, Palm Beach, and Monroe counties—is a national model for regional climate coordination, producing the Unified Sea Level Rise Projection and joint policy recommendations.

Florida's Statewide Building Code (7th Edition, 2023) includes some of the nation's strictest wind-resistance and flood provisions, reflecting hard-won lessons from decades of hurricane damage. The state's My Safe Florida Home program provides residential wind hardening assistance.

## Regulations & Incentives

The Florida Building Code applies statewide and is updated on a 3-year cycle. Current provisions include the High-Velocity Hurricane Zone (HVHZ) for Miami-Dade and Broward counties, which requires the strictest wind-resistance testing in the nation (missile impact at 50 feet per second). All coastal counties require freeboard above BFE, ranging from 1 to 3 feet.

Florida's sales tax exemption on solar energy systems, combined with federal Investment Tax Credit, makes rooftop solar highly competitive. The state's PACE program (Ygrene, Renew Financial) finances wind hardening, flood adaptation, and energy efficiency improvements through property tax assessments.

The Resilient Florida Grant Program requires all participating localities to complete vulnerability assessments using standardized sea level rise projections. This has produced a statewide dataset of community-level flood vulnerability for the first time.

## Federal Funding Opportunities

Florida leads the nation in FEMA disaster declarations (31 since 2000) and consistently ranks among the top recipients of federal disaster and mitigation funding. HMGP allocations from Hurricane Ian alone exceed $600 million for hazard mitigation projects statewide.

The Army Corps of Engineers manages over $5 billion in active or planned Florida flood and coastal risk management projects, including the South Florida Ecosystem Restoration (CERP—$23 billion authorized), beach nourishment programs, and coastal storm risk management studies.

The Inflation Reduction Act directs significant resources to Florida through CPRG (climate pollution reduction), the Greenhouse Gas Reduction Fund (green bank financing), and EPA environmental justice programs. Florida's disadvantaged community designations under CEJST qualify numerous census tracts for priority funding.

NOAA's National Coastal Resilience Fund, the NFWF Gulf Environmental Benefit Fund, and the RESTORE Act all provide substantial funding for Florida's coastal restoration and resilience projects.

## How Council Fire Can Help

Council Fire's Florida practice is one of our deepest, spanning the state's full range of climate risks and opportunities. We support municipalities and counties with Resilient Florida Grant applications, hazard mitigation planning, and stormwater infrastructure design. Our post-disaster recovery practice has managed hundreds of millions in HMGP and CDBG-DR funds for Florida clients.

For developers and building owners, we provide Florida Building Code compliance support, climate vulnerability assessments, and green building certification. Our water resources practice addresses the intersection of sea level rise, water supply security, and Everglades restoration that defines South Florida's climate challenge. For hospitality and tourism clients, we offer climate risk assessment and adaptation planning that protects business value in the state's most competitive market.

## Frequently Asked Questions

### How much federal disaster money has Florida received?

Florida has received over $30 billion in federal disaster assistance since 2000, including FEMA Individual Assistance, Public Assistance, HMGP, CDBG-DR, and SBA disaster loans. Hurricane Ian alone triggered over $10 billion in federal disaster spending. The state's frequent disaster declarations make it the largest recipient of FEMA funding in the nation.

### What is the Resilient Florida Grant Program?

Created by the Florida Legislature in 2021, Resilient Florida provides $100 million annually (from state general revenue) for local government resilience projects. Eligible activities include vulnerability assessments, adaptation planning, and infrastructure hardening for flooding and sea level rise. Projects must use the state's standardized sea level rise projections. The program is administered by the Office of Resilience and Coastal Protection within the Department of Environmental Protection.

### Is Florida's property insurance market stable?

Florida's property insurance market has been under severe stress since 2020, with multiple insurers leaving the state, premiums doubling or tripling, and Citizens Property Insurance (the state insurer of last resort) growing to over 1.3 million policies. Factors include hurricane losses, reinsurance cost increases, litigation, and growing climate risk. Legislative reforms in 2022 and 2023 addressed litigation abuse and strengthened insurer solvency requirements. The market has stabilized somewhat, with several new entrants, but premiums remain among the nation's highest.

### How does climate change affect Florida agriculture?

Florida's $8 billion agricultural sector faces multiple climate pressures: citrus greening disease (exacerbated by warm winters), heat stress on livestock and field crops, saltwater intrusion into agricultural water supplies, and more intense rainfall events that damage crops and cause soil erosion. The citrus industry has shrunk from 800,000 acres in 2000 to under 350,000 in 2024. Climate-adaptive practices—heat-tolerant varieties, precision irrigation, soil health management—are increasingly critical for agricultural viability.
