## Climate Snapshot

Houston, Texas—population 2.3 million in the city and 7.3 million in the metro—is the fourth-largest city in the United States and the energy capital of the world. It sprawls across 670 square miles of flat Gulf Coastal Plain, laced with 2,500 miles of bayous and channels that serve as the primary drainage system for a region that receives 50 inches of rain annually.

The flooding risk is not theoretical. Hurricane Harvey in August 2017 dumped 60 inches of rain on parts of the Houston metro over four days—the most rainfall from a single storm event ever recorded in the continental United States. Harvey caused $125 billion in damages, flooded 300,000 structures, displaced 30,000 people, and killed 68 in the Houston area. It was the third "500-year" flood in three years, following the Memorial Day Flood of 2015 ($3 billion in damages) and the Tax Day Flood of 2016 ($2.7 billion).

Beyond flooding, Houston contends with extreme heat. The city averages 99 days above 90°F annually, and that number is rising. In 2023, Houston endured a record 22 consecutive days above 100°F. Hurricane Beryl in July 2024 knocked out power to 2.7 million CenterPoint Energy customers during a heat wave, creating a compound disaster that killed over 30 people from heat exposure.

## Top Climate Risks

### Flooding—Riverine, Coastal, and Pluvial

Houston's flat topography, impervious clay soils, and massive urbanization create a flooding trifecta. The Harris County Flood Control District manages 23 watersheds with over 2,500 miles of channels, many of which were designed decades ago for a fraction of today's impervious cover. Since 1990, Harris County has added 250,000 housing units, much of it on former prairie and wetland. FEMA estimates that 400,000 structures in the Houston metro sit in the 500-year floodplain. Post-Harvey analysis showed that two-thirds of flooded structures were outside FEMA's mapped 100-year floodplain.

### Extreme Heat

Houston's combination of high temperatures and high humidity produces dangerous heat index values exceeding 110°F multiple times each summer. The urban heat island effect pushes temperatures in dense neighborhoods 5–12°F above surrounding areas. Low-income communities and communities of color in neighborhoods like Kashmere Gardens, Third Ward, and Sunnyside face the highest exposure with the least access to air conditioning and tree canopy. Climate models project an additional 20–30 days above 100°F by 2050.

### Hurricanes and Tropical Storms

Houston lies 50 miles inland from the Gulf of Mexico but remains highly vulnerable to tropical systems. Beyond Harvey, Hurricane Ike in 2008 caused $30 billion in damages across the Houston-Galveston region with a 15-foot storm surge that devastated Galveston and Bolivar Peninsula. A direct hit from a major hurricane tracking up the Houston Ship Channel could cause a chemical release catastrophe given the 400+ petrochemical facilities concentrated along the waterway.

## Local Climate Action

Houston's Climate Action Plan (2020) commits to carbon neutrality by 2050, with a near-term target of 40% emissions reduction by 2030. The plan focuses on transportation (the largest local emissions source at 43%), building energy, and industrial emissions. Houston is investing $200 million in bike infrastructure and transit expansion, though the sprawling metro makes transportation decarbonization exceptionally challenging.

The Harris County Flood Control District's $2.5 billion bond program, approved by voters in 2018, is funding 237 flood mitigation projects across the county, including channel widening, detention basins, and property buyouts. Over 3,000 repetitive-loss structures have been acquired and demolished since 1985.

Houston has been a surprising leader in renewable energy, becoming the first major U.S. city to power all municipal operations with 100% renewable energy (achieved in 2023). The city's Green Building Resolution requires LEED Silver certification for new municipal construction.

## Regulations & Incentives

Texas does not have a state climate plan, and the regulatory environment for climate action is limited at the state level. However, local regulations have teeth. Harris County updated its floodplain regulations post-Harvey, requiring new construction in the 500-year floodplain to elevate 2 feet above the 500-year flood elevation—one of the strictest standards in the country.

Houston's Chapter 19 stormwater regulations require detention for new development to mitigate increased runoff. The city's commercial PACE program (Texas PACE) enables property owners to finance energy efficiency, water conservation, and resilience upgrades through property assessments.

Texas offers property tax exemptions for solar and wind installations. The state's deregulated electricity market allows Houston consumers to choose 100% renewable energy plans, often at competitive rates. CenterPoint Energy provides rebates for energy-efficient HVAC, insulation, and weatherization.

## Federal Funding Opportunities

Houston has been one of the largest recipients of federal disaster and mitigation funding in the nation. Post-Harvey CDBG-DR allocations to Texas exceeded $5 billion, with the majority directed to the Houston metro. FEMA HMGP and BRIC funds have supported the county's ongoing buyout program and drainage infrastructure upgrades.

The Army Corps' Houston Ship Channel Expansion and Coastal Spine Study evaluates a $31 billion "Ike Dike" coastal barrier system to protect Galveston Bay from storm surge. The project received initial authorization in 2022.

IRA incentives are substantial in the Houston market: HEEHRA rebates for electrification, 30% solar ITC (particularly impactful given Houston's solar resource), and Greenhouse Gas Reduction Fund financing. The DOE Loan Programs Office has also funded clean energy projects in the Houston petrochemical corridor.

## How Council Fire Can Help

Houston's scale—physical, economic, and regulatory—demands resilience partners who can operate across every dimension. Council Fire works with property owners, developers, industrial facilities, and government agencies to reduce climate risk and capture available funding.

For commercial and industrial clients, we provide flood risk assessments, resilience retrofit design, and PACE financing navigation. Our federal grant expertise supports applications to BRIC, CDBG-DR, and HMGP programs, helping clients build the benefit-cost analyses that competitive applications require.

Council Fire also helps Houston's energy sector navigate the transition, connecting petrochemical facilities with DOE decarbonization programs and supporting clean energy project development. From buyout program administration to building electrification, Council Fire brings the depth Houston's complex risk landscape demands.

## Frequently Asked Questions

### What are the biggest climate risks facing Houston?

Flooding is Houston's dominant risk—the city has experienced three "500-year" floods since 2015, and 400,000 structures sit in the 500-year floodplain. Extreme heat, amplified by humidity and urban heat islands, is a growing killer. Hurricanes threaten both catastrophic storm surge and compound disasters when they knock out power during heat events.

### Does Houston have a climate action plan?

Yes. Houston's 2020 Climate Action Plan targets carbon neutrality by 2050, with a 40% emissions reduction by 2030. The city powers all municipal operations with 100% renewable energy. Harris County's $2.5 billion flood bond funds 237 mitigation projects. However, Texas state policy does not support statewide climate targets.

### What federal funding is available for climate resilience in Texas?

Texas has received over $5 billion in post-Harvey CDBG-DR funds alone. FEMA BRIC and HMGP grants fund ongoing buyouts and drainage upgrades. The Army Corps' $31 billion coastal spine study could transform storm surge protection for the Houston-Galveston region. IRA tax credits and rebates support building electrification and solar deployment statewide.

### What is the "Ike Dike"?

The Coastal Texas Protection and Restoration Study, commonly called the "Ike Dike," proposes a series of storm surge gates, levees, and beach nourishment projects spanning Galveston Bay. Estimated at $31 billion, it would protect the Houston Ship Channel, petrochemical facilities, and coastal communities from hurricane surge. Initial federal authorization was secured in 2022, but full funding and construction remain years away.
