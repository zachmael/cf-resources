## Climate Snapshot

West Palm Beach anchors Palm Beach County's urban core along the Lake Worth Lagoon, with the Atlantic Ocean less than three miles to the east and the Everglades drainage basin to the west. The city's elevation ranges from sea level along the waterfront to roughly 20 feet inland—modest topography that leaves large swaths of the metro vulnerable to both coastal and inland flooding.

Palm Beach County has warmed approximately 2°F since the 1960s. The Southeast Florida Regional Climate Change Compact projects 10 to 17 inches of sea level rise by 2040 and 21 to 54 inches by 2060, with implications for every aspect of the built environment. The region's wet season (June through October) coincides with hurricane season, creating compound flood risk when storm surge meets saturated soils and elevated water tables.

Palm Beach County is the third-most populous county in Florida (1.5 million residents) and contains over $100 billion in assessed property value, much of it concentrated along the coast. The agricultural sector west of the city—including the Everglades Agricultural Area—faces its own climate pressures from changing precipitation patterns and water management conflicts.

## Top Climate Risks

### Sea Level Rise & Coastal Flooding

The Lake Worth Lagoon's connection to the Atlantic makes waterfront properties directly susceptible to tidal flooding. King tides already cause regular inundation along Flagler Drive and in the Northwood and Flamingo Park neighborhoods. The Compact's projections suggest that by 2060, daily high tides could reach levels that currently qualify as minor flood events, affecting roads, stormwater outfalls, and underground utilities.

### Hurricane & Storm Surge

Palm Beach County's last direct major hurricane impact was Jeanne (2004), which caused $7.5 billion in regional damage. A Category 4 storm on a direct westward track could push 8–12 feet of surge into the Lake Worth Lagoon. The county's hurricane evacuation zones encompass over 400,000 residents. With sea level rise, future storms will produce higher surge from weaker systems.

### Extreme Heat & Public Health

West Palm Beach averages 85 days per year above 90°F, with heat index values regularly exceeding 105°F from June through September. Projections suggest 110–130 days above 90°F by 2050 under moderate emissions. Heat-related illness disproportionately affects outdoor workers, the homeless population, and elderly residents in non-air-conditioned housing. Urban heat islands in downtown and along major corridors amplify temperatures by 4–6°F.

## Local Climate Action

Palm Beach County adopted its Climate Action Plan in 2023, setting a target of 50% greenhouse gas reduction by 2035 and net-zero by 2050 (from a 2018 baseline). Priority actions include building energy benchmarking, transit electrification, and a 100% renewable energy target for county operations by 2035.

The City of West Palm Beach updated its Comprehensive Plan in 2024 to include climate resilience elements, requiring sea level rise vulnerability analysis for all major development applications. The city's water utility has invested $200 million in treatment plant upgrades and aquifer storage and recovery (ASR) systems to buffer against drought and saltwater intrusion.

The county's Climate Resilience Program, launched in 2022, coordinates vulnerability assessments, adaptation planning, and community engagement across 39 municipalities. A countywide resilience officer oversees implementation.

## Regulations & Incentives

Palm Beach County enforces the Florida Building Code with a 1-foot freeboard requirement for new construction in flood zones. The county's 2024 Resilient Development Standards require projects over 50 units or 50,000 sq ft to submit a climate vulnerability assessment addressing sea level rise, flooding, and extreme heat.

Florida's PACE program is active in Palm Beach County, financing wind hardening, solar, and flood mitigation. The county's Green Building Incentive Program offers expedited permitting and fee reductions for projects achieving LEED, NGBS, or Florida Green Building Coalition certification.

FPL's SolarTogether community solar program allows residents and businesses without suitable roofs to subscribe to utility-scale solar at competitive rates.

## Federal Funding Opportunities

The Southeast Florida Regional Resilience Partnership—successor to the Compact's federal advocacy efforts—coordinates regional applications for BRIC, CPRG, and other federal resilience programs. Palm Beach County has received over $20 million in FEMA mitigation grants since 2018.

The Army Corps of Engineers' Central and Southern Florida project includes Everglades restoration components that directly affect Palm Beach County's flood control and water supply infrastructure. The Comprehensive Everglades Restoration Plan (CERP) represents over $23 billion in authorized federal investment.

EPA's CWSRF and DWSRF programs provide low-interest financing for water infrastructure resilience. The county's water utilities have accessed over $150 million in revolving fund loans.

The DOE's Energy Efficiency and Conservation Block Grant (EECBG) program, reauthorized through the Inflation Reduction Act, provides formula funding to Palm Beach County for building energy efficiency, renewable energy, and transportation electrification projects.

## How Council Fire Can Help

Council Fire works with Palm Beach County communities on the full spectrum of climate resilience and sustainability challenges. We support municipal clients with comprehensive plan updates, climate vulnerability assessments, and resilient development standard implementation. Our federal funding team has deep experience with FEMA BRIC, CPRG, and Army Corps programs relevant to Southeast Florida.

For private sector clients, we provide climate risk assessments for real estate portfolios, green building certification support, and ESG reporting aligned with SEC climate disclosure requirements. Our water resources practice supports utilities navigating the intersection of Everglades restoration, sea level rise, and growing demand.

## Frequently Asked Questions

### How does the Everglades affect West Palm Beach's flood risk?

The Everglades and the South Florida Water Management District's canal and levee system are integral to Palm Beach County's flood management. Water flows southward from Lake Okeechobee through the Everglades Agricultural Area and into the Everglades, with the system managed to balance flood control, water supply, and environmental restoration. As sea levels rise, the system's ability to drain floodwater by gravity diminishes, requiring more pump capacity and operational flexibility.

### What should homeowners know about flood insurance in Palm Beach County?

Approximately 180,000 National Flood Insurance Program policies are in force in Palm Beach County—among the highest in the nation. Under Risk Rating 2.0, premiums now reflect individual property risk rather than flood zone alone. Properties with higher elevations, newer construction, and mitigation features generally pay less. The county's floodplain management office provides free flood zone determinations and elevation certificate guidance.

### Is West Palm Beach planning for sea level rise in new development?

Yes. The city's updated Comprehensive Plan requires sea level rise vulnerability analysis for major development proposals, using the Compact's 2060 projection as the planning horizon. The plan also includes policies encouraging higher first-floor elevations, living shorelines along the Lake Worth Lagoon, and green infrastructure in new development. Palm Beach County's Resilient Development Standards add a county-level review layer for large projects.
