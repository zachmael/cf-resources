## Climate Snapshot

San Juan, the capital of Puerto Rico, is home to approximately 320,000 residents in the municipality and 2.2 million across the San Juan metro area—roughly 65% of Puerto Rico's population. The city stretches along the Atlantic coast of the island's northeastern corner, with dense urban development extending inland through river valleys and hillsides.

Hurricane Maria in September 2017 defined a generation. The Category 4 storm made landfall with 155 mph winds, causing an estimated $90 billion in damages across the island—at the time, the third-costliest hurricane in U.S. history. The death toll was staggering: a Harvard study estimated nearly 5,000 excess deaths in the six months following landfall, largely from infrastructure collapse rather than the storm itself. Puerto Rico's power grid failed completely, and some communities went without electricity for 11 months. Two years earlier, Hurricane Irma had skirted the island, causing $500 million in damages and revealing the fragility that Maria would exploit.

The grid remains Puerto Rico's Achilles heel. LUMA Energy, which assumed operations in 2021, has struggled with reliability—island-wide blackouts occurred in April 2022 and September 2024, some triggered by relatively minor events. Six years after Maria, an estimated 30,000 homes still had temporary roof repairs (blue tarps). Climate change is intensifying the hurricanes and rainfall events that Puerto Rico cannot yet withstand.

## Top Climate Risks

### Hurricanes and Tropical Storms

Puerto Rico sits in the heart of the Atlantic hurricane belt. Climate models project a 10–15% increase in the intensity of the strongest hurricanes by 2050, with rainfall rates increasing 20–30%. Maria's destruction demonstrated that San Juan's building stock, infrastructure, and emergency systems cannot survive a major hurricane without catastrophic consequences. The island's geography—mountainous terrain catching moisture-laden winds—amplifies rainfall; Maria dropped 37 inches in some locations.

### Grid Fragility and Energy Insecurity

Puerto Rico's centralized power grid, rebuilt after Maria along largely the same vulnerable above-ground corridors, remains the island's most critical infrastructure weakness. A single transmission tower failure can cascade into island-wide blackouts. PREPA's legacy debt ($9 billion) and LUMA's operational challenges have delayed grid modernization. Without distributed energy and microgrids, every hurricane, tropical storm, or equipment failure threatens extended blackouts that compromise hospitals, water treatment, communications, and refrigeration for medications and food.

### Flooding—Coastal and Inland

Sea-level rise projections for San Juan range from 1 to 3 feet by 2060. The Condado, Ocean Park, and Isla Verde beachfront areas face chronic erosion and surge risk. Inland, the Río Piedras watershed floods regularly during intense rainfall, damaging homes and businesses in the Hato Rey financial district and surrounding neighborhoods. The combination of upstream development, inadequate stormwater infrastructure, and intensifying rainfall makes urban flooding a persistent and worsening hazard.

## Local Climate Action

Puerto Rico's Climate Change Mitigation, Adaptation, and Resilience Plan (2022) sets a framework for island-wide action, though implementation has been slowed by fiscal constraints and governance challenges. The plan targets 60% renewable energy by 2040 and 100% by 2050, aligned with Puerto Rico's Energy Public Policy Act (Act 17-2019).

Solar deployment has accelerated dramatically—Puerto Rico added over 1 GW of rooftop solar between 2019 and 2024, driven by household demand for energy independence after Maria. Battery storage paired with solar has created de facto microgrids across thousands of homes. The Puerto Rico Electric Power Authority (PREPA) and LUMA are developing utility-scale solar-plus-storage projects, though permitting and interconnection delays persist.

San Juan's municipal government has invested in green infrastructure, coastal resilience, and community emergency preparedness. The Caño Martín Peña restoration project ($250 million, funded by CDBG-DR) is dredging and restoring an urban tidal channel, improving drainage and reducing flooding for 26,000 residents.

## Regulations & Incentives

Puerto Rico's Act 60-2019 provides tax incentives for renewable energy equipment and energy storage. The island's net metering policy supports rooftop solar deployment. Puerto Rico's building code was updated after Maria to require hurricane-resistant construction, including impact-resistant windows and reinforced roof connections.

The Puerto Rico Energy Bureau regulates utility operations and has pushed for distributed energy and microgrid development. Federal tax credits—including the 30% solar ITC and residential clean energy credits—apply fully in Puerto Rico, though the territory's tax status means credits work differently (direct payment provisions under the IRA are critical for Puerto Rico's tax-exempt entities).

FEMA's Hazard Mitigation Grant Program (HMGP) post-Maria is the largest in U.S. history at $3.2 billion, funding home hardening, infrastructure upgrades, and community resilience projects across the island.

## Federal Funding Opportunities

Puerto Rico has received unprecedented federal investment since Maria. CDBG-DR allocations to Puerto Rico total $20.3 billion—the largest CDBG-DR award to any jurisdiction in history. These funds support housing repair and reconstruction, infrastructure, economic recovery, and resilience planning. However, disbursement has been slow: by 2025, only about 40% of the allocated funds had been expended.

FEMA's $3.2 billion HMGP supports the FEMA 404 Mitigation Program for individual home hardening, community shelters, and infrastructure protection. The $12 billion FEMA Public Assistance obligation for Maria recovery continues to fund infrastructure rebuilding.

IRA direct pay provisions are transformative for Puerto Rico—enabling tax-exempt entities (municipalities, cooperatives, nonprofits) to receive solar, storage, and efficiency incentives as direct payments. The DOE's Grid Resilience and Innovation Partnerships (GRIP) program funds microgrid and grid modernization projects. EPA's Greenhouse Gas Reduction Fund supports clean energy financing.

## Frequently Asked Questions

### What are the biggest climate risks facing San Juan?

Hurricanes are the existential threat—Maria caused $90 billion in damages and nearly 5,000 deaths in 2017. Grid fragility means that even moderate storms can trigger extended blackouts. Coastal and inland flooding from sea-level rise and intense rainfall compound hurricane risk. The building stock remains partially unrepaired from Maria.

### Does San Juan have a climate action plan?

Puerto Rico's Climate Change Plan targets 100% renewable energy by 2050. Over 1 GW of rooftop solar has been installed since Maria. The $250 million Caño Martín Peña restoration improves drainage for 26,000 residents. Individual home hardening through FEMA's HMGP is strengthening the building stock.

### What federal funding is available for climate resilience in Puerto Rico?

Puerto Rico has received $20.3 billion in CDBG-DR funds—the largest allocation in U.S. history—plus $3.2 billion in FEMA HMGP and $12 billion in FEMA Public Assistance. IRA direct pay provisions enable clean energy deployment by tax-exempt entities. DOE GRIP and EPA Greenhouse Gas Reduction Fund provide additional support.

### Why is Puerto Rico's power grid so fragile?

The grid relies on centralized generation and long above-ground transmission lines crossing mountainous terrain. PREPA's $9 billion legacy debt deferred maintenance for decades. Maria destroyed 80% of the grid. Rebuilding has been slow, following largely the same vulnerable corridors. Distributed solar and microgrids are the most promising path to energy resilience.
