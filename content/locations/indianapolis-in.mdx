## Climate Snapshot

Indianapolis, Indiana's capital and largest city, has a consolidated city-county population of approximately 887,000 and a metro area of 2.1 million. The city sits on relatively flat terrain in central Indiana, drained by the White River, Fall Creek, Eagle Creek, and Pleasant Run—waterways that define the city's flood geography. Indianapolis's flat topography and heavy clay soils limit natural drainage, making the city highly dependent on engineered stormwater infrastructure.

In June 2023, a slow-moving thunderstorm complex dropped 5 inches of rain across the south side in three hours, flooding over 1,500 homes along Pleasant Run and Bean Creek. Damages exceeded $55 million, and the event triggered the fourth federal disaster declaration for Marion County since 2008. In August 2024, another severe rain event caused $35 million in damages along Fall Creek, flooding the Broad Ripple neighborhood. Indianapolis's combined sewer system, operated by Citizens Energy Group, overflows an estimated 6 billion gallons annually—one of the largest CSO problems in the Midwest.

Indianapolis recorded 38 days above 90°F in 2023, up from a historical average of 22. The city's expansive surface parking, wide roadways, and low tree canopy (29%, one of the lowest among major Midwest cities) amplify urban heat. Central Indiana's severe storm season is also intensifying, with tornado and derecho events causing repeated disruptions.

## Top Climate Risks

### Urban and Riverine Flooding
Indianapolis's combined sewer system and flat terrain create severe, recurring flood risk. Citizens Energy Group's DigIndy tunnel project—a $2 billion, 28-mile deep rock tunnel system—is designed to capture 97% of CSO volume upon completion in 2025. However, surface flooding from overwhelmed storm drains and creek overflow remains a distinct and growing problem. Marion County has over 7,000 structures in the 100-year floodplain, with the Pleasant Run, Fall Creek, and Pogues Run corridors most affected. Climate projections indicate a 20-25% increase in heavy precipitation events by 2050.

### Extreme Heat
Indianapolis's urban heat island is among the most severe in the Midwest, driven by the city's car-centric development pattern—the metro area has an estimated 120 square miles of surface parking. A 2023 Indiana University study mapped temperature differentials of up to 12°F between the near-east side (predominantly low-income and minority) and suburban areas with mature tree canopy. Marion County heat-related emergency calls increased 65% between 2018 and 2023. An estimated 18% of Indianapolis households lack air conditioning.

### Severe Storms and Tornadoes
Central Indiana averages 22 tornadoes per year statewide, and Indianapolis is not immune. A November 2013 tornado outbreak produced an EF-2 tornado in the south Indianapolis suburbs, and a June 2023 derecho caused $120 million in damages across the metro area with 90 mph straight-line winds. Ice storms pose winter risk—the January 2009 ice storm left 200,000 without power for up to a week. Climate models project increasing intensity of severe convective storms across the Midwest.

## Local Climate Action

Indianapolis adopted its Thrive Indianapolis sustainability plan in 2019, updated in 2023, with a target of 75% greenhouse gas reduction by 2050 from a 2016 baseline. The plan's 2030 interim target is a 35% reduction. Mayor Joe Hogsett signed the Climate Pledge in 2017, committing the city to Paris Agreement alignment.

The city's most significant infrastructure investment is the DigIndy tunnel system, which upon completion in 2025 will virtually eliminate combined sewer overflows—representing one of the largest environmental infrastructure projects in the Midwest. Citizens Energy Group has invested $2 billion over 12 years in the project.

Indianapolis's Department of Public Works launched the Indy Urban Tree Equity program in 2022, targeting the planting of 30,000 trees by 2030 in neighborhoods with less than 20% canopy coverage. The city's Complete Streets policy (2022) requires new road projects to include green infrastructure and pedestrian amenities. IndyGo's Red Line and Purple Line bus rapid transit corridors, funded with $150 million in federal and local investment, are reducing transportation emissions along the city's highest-ridership routes.

## Regulations & Incentives

Indiana lacks a state-level climate action plan or renewable portfolio standard, placing primary responsibility on local government. However, Indiana Michigan Power and Indianapolis Power & Light (AES Indiana) offer net metering and various energy efficiency rebate programs. AES Indiana's proposed 2024 Integrated Resource Plan includes retiring all coal generation by 2030.

Citizens Energy Group's stormwater fee credit program provides up to 50% reduction for properties implementing green infrastructure. Marion County's building code incorporates the 2018 IECC for energy efficiency. The Indianapolis PACE program (established 2019) allows commercial properties to finance clean energy and resilience upgrades through property assessments.

Indiana's Residential Energy Efficiency Tax Deduction provides a state income tax deduction for energy efficiency improvements, though the value is modest. The state's weatherization program serves approximately 3,500 households annually.

## Federal Funding Opportunities

Indiana's IRA Home Energy Rebate allocation totals $124 million. Indianapolis residents can access up to $8,000 for heat pump installations and $14,000 for income-qualified households. Federal 30% tax credits for solar, batteries, and efficiency improvements are available through 2032.

FEMA BRIC has been an important funding source, with $14 million awarded to Marion County in 2023 for flood mitigation along Pleasant Run and Fall Creek. The EPA's Water Infrastructure Finance and Innovation Act (WIFIA) provided $436 million in financing for the DigIndy tunnel project. DOT RAISE grants funded $20 million of the IndyGo Red Line BRT construction.

HUD's CDBG program provides Indianapolis approximately $11 million annually, portions of which support flood mitigation and resilient housing. The DOE Weatherization program allocated $18 million to Indiana in 2023. EPA's Climate Pollution Reduction Grants provided the Indianapolis region with planning funds, with implementation grants of up to $500 million available competitively.
