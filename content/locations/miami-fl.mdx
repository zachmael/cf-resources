## Climate Snapshot

Miami, with a metro population of 6.2 million and a city population of roughly 440,000, is routinely cited as the most climate-vulnerable major city in the United States. Built on porous limestone atop the Biscayne Aquifer, Miami cannot rely on traditional seawalls — water rises from below as much as it pushes from the coast. The city's $400 billion in coastal property value is the highest concentration of climate-exposed real estate in the world.

Hurricane Irma in September 2017 caused an estimated $50 billion in damages across Florida, with Miami-Dade County absorbing significant wind and storm surge impacts. King tide flooding now inundates parts of Miami Beach, Brickell, and Coconut Grove 6–10 times per year without any storm. In April 2023, Fort Lauderdale — 30 miles north — received 25 inches of rain in 24 hours, an event that flooded 1,200 homes and shut down Fort Lauderdale-Hollywood International Airport.

Sea levels at the Virginia Key tide gauge have risen 12 inches since 1930 and are accelerating. Southeast Florida's Regional Climate Change Compact projects 10–17 inches of additional rise by 2040 and 21–54 inches by 2060, numbers that threaten not just waterfront properties but the freshwater supply for 6 million people.

## Top Climate Risks

### Sea Level Rise & Tidal Flooding

Miami's porous limestone bedrock means seawalls alone cannot stop rising water — it percolates upward through the ground. The Biscayne Aquifer, which supplies drinking water for the entire metro area, is vulnerable to saltwater intrusion as sea levels rise. Miami-Dade County already spends $50 million annually on stormwater pump upgrades and drainage improvements. FEMA's National Risk Index ranks Miami-Dade in the 99th percentile for coastal flooding.

### Hurricanes & Storm Surge

Miami sits in the crosshairs of Atlantic hurricane tracks. Hurricane Andrew (1992) caused $27.3 billion in damages and destroyed 63,000 homes in Miami-Dade. Hurricane Irma (2017) caused $50 billion statewide. Storm surge modeling by the Army Corps of Engineers shows a Category 4 hurricane striking Miami from the southeast could generate 15–20 feet of surge in Biscayne Bay, inundating downtown Miami up to NW 2nd Avenue.

### Extreme Heat & Humidity

Miami averages 140+ days per year with heat indices above 90°F, projected to exceed 180 days by 2050. Wet-bulb temperatures — the combination of heat and humidity that limits the body's ability to cool — approach dangerous thresholds during South Florida summers. Outdoor workers, the elderly, and unhoused populations face acute health risks. Miami-Dade appointed the nation's first Chief Heat Officer in 2021 to coordinate heat response.

## Local Climate Action

Miami-Dade County's Sea Level Rise Strategy (2021) guides $4 billion in planned infrastructure investments over 40 years. The strategy prioritizes stormwater system upgrades, raising road elevations, and adapting building codes to higher flood levels. Miami Beach alone has spent over $700 million since 2015 on pump stations, raised roads, and improved drainage — the most intensive municipal adaptation program in the U.S.

The City of Miami's Miami Forever Climate Ready plan (2020) targets carbon neutrality by 2050 and outlines adaptation strategies across transportation, buildings, ecosystems, and public health. Key initiatives include expanding the urban tree canopy by 30%, requiring sea level rise projections in all capital project planning, and creating a resilience bond mechanism to finance adaptation.

The Southeast Florida Regional Climate Change Compact — a four-county partnership among Miami-Dade, Broward, Palm Beach, and Monroe counties — is the nation's leading example of regional climate governance. The Compact publishes unified sea level rise projections and coordinates infrastructure planning across jurisdictional boundaries.

## Regulations & Incentives

Florida's building code, updated after Hurricane Andrew, is the strongest wind-resistance standard in the nation. Miami-Dade County imposes additional requirements including impact-resistant glazing and enhanced roof attachment standards. The county's freeboard requirement mandates new construction one foot above the base flood elevation, though advocates push for two feet.

Florida lacks a statewide renewable portfolio standard but offers property tax exemptions for solar and battery storage installations (100% exemption from added assessed value). The state's net metering program is available for systems up to 2 MW. FPL (Florida Power & Light) operates the SolarTogether community solar program, the largest utility-scale community solar initiative in the country.

Miami-Dade County's Green Building Ordinance requires LEED certification or equivalent for all county-funded projects over $2 million. The county's Office of Resilience administers a Resilient305 initiative that provides technical assistance and planning support.

## Federal Funding Opportunities

The Army Corps of Engineers' Miami-Dade Back Bay Study — a $6 billion federal flood risk management project — is the largest resilience infrastructure study in Florida's history. Phase 1 includes surge barriers, pump stations, and elevated infrastructure along Biscayne Bay.

FEMA's BRIC program allocated $1 billion nationally in FY2024, with Florida among the top recipient states. Miami-Dade has received BRIC funding for critical facility hardening and stormwater capacity projects. The Hazard Mitigation Grant Program (HMGP) provides post-disaster funding — Florida has received over $2 billion in HMGP grants since 2017.

The IRA directs $9 billion to residential energy efficiency rebates through state programs, including Florida's Home Energy Rebate Program. The National Flood Insurance Program (NFIP) underwrites 700,000+ policies in Florida, though Risk Rating 2.0 is significantly increasing premiums in South Florida — creating financial urgency for mitigation investments that reduce risk scores.

## How Council Fire Can Help

Council Fire brings a rare combination of coastal resilience expertise and federal funding strategy that Miami's public and private sectors urgently need. Our 15+ years of partnership with the Environmental Defense Fund on ocean health and fisheries management informs our understanding of the marine ecosystems — coral reefs, mangroves, seagrass beds — that serve as Miami's first line of defense against storm surge.

Our experience with the Army Corps of Engineers and NOAA equips us to help Miami-area clients navigate the Back Bay Study process, position for BRIC and HMGP grants, and integrate nature-based solutions into hard infrastructure planning. For real estate developers and property managers facing rising insurance costs under Risk Rating 2.0, we provide flood risk reduction strategies that demonstrably lower premiums. Council Fire's work with the Maryland Port Administration — delivering $125 million in savings through sustainability-driven planning — translates directly to PortMiami's climate adaptation needs.

## Frequently Asked Questions

### What are the biggest climate risks facing Miami?

Sea level rise and tidal flooding are Miami's most existential risks, compounded by the porous limestone geology that prevents conventional flood barriers from working. Hurricanes and storm surge threaten catastrophic damage — modeling shows a Category 4 storm could push 15–20 feet of surge into downtown. Extreme heat with humidity approaching wet-bulb danger thresholds is an escalating public health crisis.

### Does Miami have a climate action plan?

Yes. The City of Miami's Miami Forever Climate Ready plan (2020) targets carbon neutrality by 2050. Miami-Dade County's Sea Level Rise Strategy (2021) guides $4 billion in infrastructure investments over 40 years. The four-county Southeast Florida Regional Climate Change Compact coordinates regional adaptation planning.

### What federal funding is available for climate resilience in Florida?

The Army Corps' $6 billion Miami-Dade Back Bay Study is the flagship federal project. Florida receives among the highest allocations nationally from FEMA's BRIC and HMGP programs — over $2 billion in HMGP since 2017. IRA residential energy rebates, EPA climate justice grants, and FEMA flood mitigation assistance are all available statewide.

### Why can't Miami just build seawalls to stop sea level rise?

Miami's bedrock is porous oolitic limestone. Water passes through it like a sponge, meaning traditional seawalls and levees cannot prevent groundwater rise and saltwater intrusion. The city must combine pump systems, elevated infrastructure, nature-based solutions like mangrove restoration, and building code adaptations to address rising water from both above and below.
