## Climate Snapshot

Mobile occupies the northwestern shore of Mobile Bay, where the Mobile and Tensaw rivers empty into the Gulf of Mexico. This geography makes the city one of the most hurricane-exposed metros in the United States—it sits within 60 miles of the Gulf coast and has been affected by more than 25 tropical systems since 2000. Mobile also holds the distinction of being the wettest city in the contiguous U.S., averaging roughly 66 inches of rainfall annually.

Temperatures in the Mobile metro have trended upward by about 1.5°F since 1970, with nights warming faster than days. The Gulf of Mexico's surface temperatures have increased roughly 1.5°F over the same period, fueling more intense precipitation events and stronger storm surges. Tide gauge data at Dauphin Island shows approximately 14 inches of relative sea level rise over the past century.

The city's economy relies on aerospace manufacturing (Airbus's U.S. assembly facility), the Port of Mobile (Alabama's only deepwater port), shipbuilding at Austal USA, and a growing healthcare sector. All face varying degrees of climate exposure, from supply chain disruptions during hurricane season to heat-related workforce productivity losses.

## Top Climate Risks

### Hurricanes & Storm Surge

Mobile Bay funnels storm surge, amplifying water levels during landfalling hurricanes. Hurricane Sally (2020) pushed 5–7 feet of surge into downtown Mobile and dropped 30 inches of rain in 24 hours, causing $7.3 billion in damage across the region. NOAA's SLOSH models show a Category 3 storm could drive 15–20 feet of surge into the upper bay. Roughly 40% of Mobile County's population lives in areas vulnerable to Category 3 surge.

### Inland & Riverine Flooding

The Three Mile Creek watershed, which drains much of western Mobile, floods repeatedly during heavy rain events. Aging stormwater infrastructure—some dating to the 1940s—cannot handle the 20% increase in heavy precipitation events observed since 1990. FEMA estimates that flood damages in Mobile County average $25 million annually, with low-income and minority neighborhoods disproportionately affected.

### Extreme Heat & Humidity

Mobile already averages 75 days per year above 90°F. Climate projections from the Fourth National Climate Assessment suggest that figure could reach 110–130 days by 2060 under a high-emissions scenario. Wet-bulb temperatures—the combination of heat and humidity that limits the body's ability to cool—regularly approach dangerous thresholds during summer months, putting outdoor workers, elderly residents, and those without air conditioning at serious risk.

## Local Climate Action

The City of Mobile adopted its Resilience Strategy in 2022, built on the city's participation in the Rockefeller Foundation's 100 Resilient Cities network. The strategy identifies 42 actions across four pillars: infrastructure hardening, environmental restoration, economic diversification, and community capacity building.

Mobile's municipal government committed to reducing city operations emissions by 30% by 2030 (from a 2018 baseline). Progress includes LED streetlight conversion (80% complete as of 2025), solar installations on three municipal buildings totaling 800 kW, and a fleet electrification pilot with 20 EVs.

The Mobile Bay National Estuary Program has invested over $50 million in watershed restoration, oyster reef construction, and living shoreline projects since 2015. These nature-based solutions reduce flood risk while supporting fisheries and water quality.

## Regulations & Incentives

Alabama's building code adoption is locally optional, and Mobile County adopted the 2021 International Building Code with wind-speed provisions calibrated to the Gulf coast. The city's flood damage prevention ordinance requires 1 foot of freeboard above BFE for residential structures and 2 feet for critical facilities.

Alabama offers a sales tax exemption on Energy Star appliances and equipment. Alabama Power's Smart Neighborhood program provides incentives for high-efficiency new construction, including spray foam insulation, smart thermostats, and rooftop solar integration. The South Alabama Regional Planning Commission administers weatherization assistance for qualifying households.

The Alabama Department of Environmental Management (ADEM) runs a revolving loan fund for stormwater and water quality projects, with below-market interest rates available to municipalities.

## Federal Funding Opportunities

FEMA BRIC grants have funded over $15 million in Mobile County projects since 2020, including a major Three Mile Creek drainage improvement and community safe room construction. The FY2025 BRIC cycle offers up to $50 million per project.

The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers' Mobile Harbor Channel deepening and widening project ($366 million authorized) includes ecosystem restoration components that improve coastal resilience. Additional Corps planning assistance is available through the Silver Jackets program.

The Inflation Reduction Act's $3 billion Environmental and Climate Justice Block Grants provide funding for community-led resilience projects in disadvantaged communities—Mobile has multiple census tracts qualifying under the Climate and Economic Justice Screening Tool (CEJST).

NOAA's Regional Coastal Resilience Grants and the National Coastal Resilience Fund (NFWF) have funded living shoreline and marsh restoration projects in Mobile Bay, with typical awards of $1–5 million.

## How Council Fire Can Help

Council Fire brings Gulf Coast resilience expertise to Mobile's complex challenge set. We support municipal and county clients with hazard mitigation planning, BRIC and HMGP grant applications, and post-disaster recovery program management. Our team has direct experience with CDBG-DR administration in hurricane-impacted Gulf communities.

For industrial and port clients, we conduct climate vulnerability assessments covering wind, surge, heat, and supply chain disruption scenarios. Our sustainability practice helps manufacturers and large employers meet ESG reporting requirements, reduce energy costs, and build operational resilience against extreme weather disruptions.

## Frequently Asked Questions

### How does Mobile compare to other Gulf Coast cities in hurricane risk?

Mobile ranks among the top five most hurricane-vulnerable metro areas in the U.S. based on historical storm frequency, surge exposure, and population in the floodplain. Its position at the head of Mobile Bay creates a funneling effect that amplifies surge. Since 2004, the metro has been directly affected by Hurricanes Ivan, Katrina, Nate, Sally, and Ida.

### What federal assistance is available after a hurricane in Mobile?

Following a presidential disaster declaration, residents can access FEMA Individual Assistance (temporary housing, home repair grants up to $42,500), SBA disaster loans, and USDA food assistance. Mobile County's Emergency Management Agency coordinates local response and publishes recovery resources. Long-term recovery funding through CDBG-DR and HMGP typically becomes available 12–24 months after a disaster.

### Is Mobile investing in nature-based flood solutions?

Yes. The Mobile Bay National Estuary Program and partners have constructed over 15 miles of living shoreline, restored 1,200 acres of coastal marsh, and installed 60 acres of oyster reef since 2015. The city's Three Mile Creek Greenway project combines recreational trail development with floodplain restoration. These projects reduce flood peaks, improve water quality, and support commercial fisheries.

### How are flood insurance rates changing for Mobile property owners?

Under FEMA's Risk Rating 2.0, many Mobile properties saw premium increases reflecting actual flood risk rather than zone-based pricing. Properties near Mobile Bay and Three Mile Creek generally experienced the largest increases. Mitigation actions—elevation certificates, flood vents, and property-level barriers—can reduce premiums by 20–60% depending on the measure.
