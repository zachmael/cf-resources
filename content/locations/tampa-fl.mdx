## Climate Snapshot

Tampa, Florida, with a population of 400,000 in the city and 3.2 million in the metro area, sits at the head of Tampa Bay—a large, shallow estuary on Florida's Gulf Coast. The city's geography is a storm surge trap: Tampa Bay narrows and funnels surge toward the urban core, amplifying water levels well beyond open-coast estimates. Average elevation in the city is just 15 feet, and large swaths of South Tampa, Davis Islands, and Bayshore Boulevard sit below 10 feet.

For decades, Tampa was considered the most hurricane-vulnerable city in the United States, yet it had not taken a direct hit from a major storm since 1921. That changed in September 2024 when Hurricane Helene pushed a record 6.5-foot storm surge into Tampa Bay, flooding thousands of homes and causing an estimated $3 billion in damages across the metro. Just two weeks later, Hurricane Milton made landfall south of Tampa as a Category 3, producing an additional 4-foot surge, spawning a historic tornado outbreak, and dumping 18 inches of rain on inland areas. Combined damages from the back-to-back storms exceeded $50 billion regionwide.

Beyond hurricanes, Tampa faces chronic flooding from sea-level rise and afternoon thunderstorms, extreme heat that produces 100+ days above 90°F annually, and an affordable housing stock highly exposed to flood damage.

## Top Climate Risks

### Hurricane Storm Surge

Tampa Bay's funnel shape amplifies storm surge. A Category 4 hurricane tracking north through the Bay could produce 15–20 feet of surge in downtown Tampa—a scenario that would inundate hospitals, the port, MacDill Air Force Base, and hundreds of thousands of homes. The 2024 back-to-back hurricanes proved the city's vulnerability is not theoretical. FEMA estimates $175 billion in property value sits within Tampa Bay's storm surge zones. The city has the second-highest financial exposure to storm surge in the United States, behind only Miami.

### Sea-Level Rise and Chronic Flooding

Sea levels in Tampa Bay have risen 8 inches since 1946 and are projected to rise an additional 1–2.5 feet by 2060. King tide flooding already affects Bayshore Boulevard, Davis Islands, and Shore Acres in neighboring St. Petersburg multiple times annually. As seas rise, the baseline water level from which storm surge builds also increases, compounding catastrophic flood risk during hurricanes.

### Extreme Heat

Tampa already experiences over 100 days above 90°F, with heat index values regularly exceeding 110°F from June through September. Climate projections show an additional 30–50 days above 95°F by 2050. The urban heat island effect pushes temperatures in East Tampa, Sulphur Springs, and University Area 5–10°F above waterfront neighborhoods. Heat-related ER visits across Hillsborough County increased 40% between 2018 and 2023.

## Local Climate Action

Tampa's Resilience Strategy, developed through partnership with the Rockefeller Foundation's 100 Resilient Cities program, identified flooding, housing affordability, and economic inequality as interconnected vulnerabilities. The city hired its first Chief Resilience Officer in 2018.

Hillsborough County's $540 million stormwater improvement program addresses chronic flooding through infrastructure upgrades, retention ponds, and green infrastructure. The city's updated comprehensive plan (2023) strengthens coastal setback requirements and limits density increases in the highest-risk surge zones.

Tampa's Climate Action and Equity Plan (2023) targets 50% emissions reduction by 2030 and net-zero by 2050. Key strategies include building electrification, expansion of HART transit, and urban forestry investment. The city has committed to planting 30,000 trees by 2030 to reduce urban heat island effects.

## Regulations & Incentives

Florida's regulatory environment for climate is complicated. The state lacks a climate action plan and has historically resisted climate-related building mandates. However, Florida's building code—updated after Hurricane Andrew in 1992—is among the strongest wind-resistant codes in the nation. The 2024 legislative session added flood resilience provisions, requiring sellers to disclose flood history and expanding the My Safe Florida Home program with $200 million for residential hardening grants.

Tampa's local floodplain ordinance requires 1 foot of freeboard above base flood elevation (FEMA minimum). Hillsborough County's Environmental Protection Commission regulates wetland impacts and stormwater management. Florida's Property Assessed Clean Energy (PACE) program enables residential and commercial financing for wind mitigation, flood barriers, and energy efficiency.

Duke Energy Florida and Tampa Electric (TECO) provide rebates for energy-efficient HVAC, solar installations, and building envelope improvements. Florida's net metering policy supports distributed solar deployment.

## Federal Funding Opportunities

The 2024 Hurricane Helene and Milton disaster declarations unlocked massive federal aid for the Tampa Bay region. FEMA Individual Assistance, Public Assistance, and HMGP allocations are expected to total several billion dollars. CDBG-DR funding for Florida's 2024 hurricane season is anticipated at $5–10 billion.

FEMA BRIC awarded Florida $23.4 million in 2023, with Tampa Bay-area projects among the recipients. The Army Corps' Tampa Bay Coastal Storm Risk Management Study evaluates regional surge protection options including barriers, seawalls, and nature-based solutions.

IRA incentives include HEEHRA rebates up to $14,000, 30% solar ITC, and Greenhouse Gas Reduction Fund financing. The DOT PROTECT program provides formula funding for Florida's climate-resilient transportation infrastructure.

## How Council Fire Can Help

The 2024 hurricanes transformed Tampa Bay's resilience conversation from planning to urgent action. Council Fire helps homeowners, businesses, and municipal agencies navigate the post-disaster recovery process while building long-term resilience.

For homeowners, we provide FEMA claim support, mitigation retrofit design, and My Safe Florida Home program navigation. For commercial property owners, Council Fire delivers flood risk assessments, resilience retrofit planning, and PACE financing guidance. Our federal grant expertise supports Tampa Bay jurisdictions pursuing BRIC, HMGP, and CDBG-DR funding for community-wide flood mitigation projects.

Council Fire's Gulf Coast practice understands the compound risks—surge, rain, heat, wind—that define Tampa Bay's climate reality. We build resilience strategies that address multiple hazards simultaneously and connect every project with available funding.

## Frequently Asked Questions

### What are the biggest climate risks facing Tampa?

Hurricane storm surge is Tampa's most catastrophic risk—the Bay's funnel shape can amplify surge to devastating levels, as the 2024 hurricanes demonstrated. Sea-level rise increases chronic tidal flooding and raises the baseline for future storm surge. Extreme heat, with 100+ days above 90°F annually, is a persistent public health threat.

### Does Tampa have a climate action plan?

Yes. Tampa's Climate Action and Equity Plan (2023) targets 50% emissions reduction by 2030 and net-zero by 2050. The city's Resilience Strategy addresses flooding, housing, and economic vulnerability. Hillsborough County is investing $540 million in stormwater improvements. Tampa has committed to planting 30,000 trees by 2030.

### What federal funding is available for climate resilience in Florida?

Florida received $23.4 million in FEMA BRIC funding in 2023. The 2024 hurricane disaster declarations unlock billions in FEMA assistance and CDBG-DR allocations. IRA incentives support electrification and solar deployment. The Army Corps Tampa Bay study evaluates regional surge protection. Florida's My Safe Florida Home program provides residential hardening grants.

### How do I protect my home from hurricane storm surge in Tampa?

Elevation is the most effective surge mitigation measure. FEMA's Flood Mitigation Assistance program can fund elevation of repetitive-loss properties. Flood barriers, impact-resistant openings, and backup power systems provide additional protection. Council Fire helps homeowners assess risk, design mitigation strategies, and access available funding.
