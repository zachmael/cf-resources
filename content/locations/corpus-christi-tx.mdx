## Climate Snapshot

Corpus Christi occupies a peninsula between Corpus Christi Bay and the Nueces Bay on the Texas Gulf Coast, with Mustang Island and Padre Island forming a barrier between the city and the open Gulf of Mexico. The city's strategic position as an energy hub—home to one of the nation's largest ports by tonnage, multiple refineries, and petrochemical facilities—places critical industrial infrastructure directly in the path of Gulf hurricanes.

Hurricane Harvey (2017) made its initial Category 4 landfall just 30 miles northeast at Rockport, hammering Corpus Christi with 130 mph gusts and 4–6 feet of storm surge. The event caused over $1 billion in local damage and exposed vulnerabilities across water, power, and transportation systems. Temperatures have increased roughly 2°F since 1970, and the region now averages over 100 days per year above 90°F.

The city's population of approximately 320,000 depends on a single water supply pipeline from Lake Texana and the Mary Rhodes Pipeline from the Colorado River—both vulnerable to drought, a risk that materialized during the 2011 drought when Corpus Christi came within weeks of severe water rationing. The intersection of hurricane risk, water scarcity, and extreme heat makes Corpus Christi's climate challenge uniquely multidimensional.

## Top Climate Risks

### Hurricane Wind & Storm Surge

Corpus Christi Bay's shallow bathymetry amplifies storm surge. NOAA SLOSH models project 12–18 feet of surge from a Category 4 storm on a direct approach. The Port of Corpus Christi, which handles over 160 million tons of cargo annually, has limited surge protection. Refinery Row along the ship channel contains billions of dollars in infrastructure with varying degrees of hardening. The city's seawall, completed in the 1940s, protects only the downtown bayfront.

### Drought & Water Supply Vulnerability

Corpus Christi's semi-arid climate (average 32 inches of rainfall annually) and dependence on distant surface water sources create acute drought vulnerability. The 2011 drought reduced Lake Corpus Christi to 30% capacity. Climate projections indicate more frequent and intense drought cycles, with potential precipitation declines of 5–15% by 2050 under moderate scenarios. Population growth further strains supply.

### Extreme Heat

With over 100 days per year above 90°F already, Corpus Christi faces dangerous heat amplification. Projections suggest 120–140 days above 90°F by 2050, with heat index values regularly exceeding 115°F. Outdoor workers in the petrochemical, construction, and agricultural sectors face the highest exposure. Energy demand peaks during heat waves strain the ERCOT grid, as the February 2021 Winter Storm Uri and subsequent summer peaks have demonstrated.

## Local Climate Action

The City of Corpus Christi adopted its Comprehensive Resilience Plan in 2023, identifying $500 million in priority projects across water security, coastal protection, and infrastructure hardening. The plan includes a desalination feasibility study (Inner Harbor site), seawall extension and modernization, and a microgrid program for critical facilities.

The Corpus Christi Regional Water Supply Group coordinates long-term water planning across 10 entities, targeting a diversified supply portfolio that includes additional pipeline capacity, aquifer storage and recovery, and brackish desalination. A 10 MGD desalination plant is in the permitting phase with a target operational date of 2028.

The Port of Corpus Christi has invested $200 million in channel deepening and hardened dock infrastructure since 2020 and has committed to a carbon-neutral port operations target by 2035, with shore power installations, solar arrays, and LNG-fueled vessel support.

## Regulations & Incentives

Texas does not adopt a statewide building code, but the City of Corpus Christi enforces the 2021 International Building Code with local wind-speed amendments (150 mph design speed). The city's flood damage prevention ordinance requires 2 feet of freeboard above BFE—one of the higher standards in Texas.

Texas Property Assessed Clean Energy (TX-PACE) enables commercial property owners to finance energy efficiency, water conservation, and resilience improvements. The Texas State Energy Conservation Office (SECO) provides grants for municipal energy audits and building retrofits.

AEP Texas offers commercial and residential rebates for high-efficiency HVAC systems, weatherization, and demand response participation.

## Federal Funding Opportunities

FEMA BRIC and HMGP programs are primary funding sources for Corpus Christi's coastal resilience projects. The city received $15 million in HMGP funding post-Harvey for drainage improvements and safe room construction.

The Army Corps of Engineers' Corpus Christi Ship Channel Improvement Project ($352 million authorized) includes ecosystem restoration and shoreline protection components. A separate Corps feasibility study for a coastal barrier system is in the reconnaissance phase.

The Bureau of Reclamation's WaterSMART program provides grants of up to $5 million for water supply resilience projects, including desalination and water recycling—directly applicable to Corpus Christi's diversification strategy.

The DOE's Industrial Decarbonization program and Hydrogen Hub initiative have relevance for Corpus Christi's refinery and petrochemical corridor, with potential investments in carbon capture and clean hydrogen production.

## How Council Fire Can Help

Council Fire brings deep expertise in Gulf Coast resilience to Corpus Christi's multi-hazard challenge set. We support municipal clients with hazard mitigation planning, water supply resilience strategy, and federal grant applications across FEMA, Corps, and Bureau of Reclamation programs.

For industrial and port clients along the ship channel, we provide climate vulnerability assessments, regulatory compliance support, and decarbonization roadmaps. Our sustainability practice helps energy-sector companies navigate evolving ESG requirements while building operational resilience against hurricanes, heat, and grid instability.

## Frequently Asked Questions

### How secure is Corpus Christi's water supply?

The city depends primarily on Lake Corpus Christi, Choke Canyon Reservoir, and the Mary Rhodes Pipeline from the Colorado River. During severe drought, combined reservoir levels have dropped below 40%. The city is pursuing supply diversification through a 10 MGD desalination plant, additional pipeline capacity, and aquifer storage. Water conservation measures, including irrigation restrictions and tiered pricing, are permanent features of the supply management strategy.

### What would a major hurricane do to Corpus Christi's industrial corridor?

A Category 4 direct hit could cause catastrophic damage to refinery and petrochemical infrastructure along the ship channel, with potential for hazardous material releases, prolonged production shutdowns, and national energy supply disruptions. Industry estimates suggest $50–100 billion in potential losses from a worst-case scenario. Post-Harvey, many facilities upgraded surge protection and emergency shutdown systems, but significant vulnerabilities remain.

### Is there a coastal barrier system planned for Corpus Christi?

The Army Corps of Engineers completed a reconnaissance study in 2024 for a coastal barrier system similar to the Ike Dike proposed for the Houston-Galveston region. The study identified multiple alternatives including surge gates, levees, and nature-based features. A full feasibility study, which would take 3–5 years and cost $30–50 million, requires congressional authorization and local cost-share commitment.
