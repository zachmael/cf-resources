## Climate Snapshot

Nashville, Tennessee's capital, has a population of approximately 694,000 within the city limits and nearly 2 million in the metro area. The city sits in the Cumberland River basin, surrounded by rolling hills that funnel stormwater into a network of creeks and tributaries. Nashville's dramatic growth—Davidson County added over 80,000 residents between 2015 and 2024—has intensified development pressure on floodplains and stormwater systems never designed for the current built environment.

The May 2010 flood remains Nashville's defining climate disaster. Over 13 inches of rain fell in 48 hours, pushing the Cumberland River to 51.9 feet—12 feet above flood stage. The event killed 21 people in Middle Tennessee and caused $2 billion in damages in Nashville alone, destroying the Grand Ole Opry House interior, Opryland Hotel, and thousands of homes. In March 2021, a separate flooding event along Sevenmile Creek killed 4 people and caused $100 million in damage to primarily low-income neighborhoods in South Nashville.

Nashville's heat exposure is rising sharply. The city recorded 58 days above 90°F in 2023, well above the historical average of 38. A 2023 urban heat island study by Vanderbilt University found temperature differentials of up to 15°F between tree-canopy-rich neighborhoods in West Nashville and concrete-heavy commercial corridors along Nolensville Pike.

## Top Climate Risks

### Inland Flooding
Nashville's topography and hydrology make flooding the city's most destructive climate risk. Metro Nashville's 2022 Stormwater Master Plan identified 12,000 structures in the 500-year floodplain and 7,800 in the 100-year floodplain, with combined replacement values exceeding $6 billion. Since the 2010 flood, the city has invested over $400 million in flood mitigation including property buyouts, detention basins, and channel improvements. Despite this, the March 2021 event proved that smaller tributaries remain deadly. Climate models project a 20-30% increase in extreme precipitation intensity across Middle Tennessee by 2060.

### Extreme Heat
Nashville's humid subtropical climate amplifies heat stress through high humidity. Wet-bulb temperatures—which measure combined heat and humidity impact on the human body—exceeded dangerous thresholds on 12 days in 2023. Heat-related deaths in Davidson County averaged 8 per year from 2019 to 2023, up from 3 per year in the 2010-2015 period. Nashville's tree canopy has declined from 43% to 38% since 2010 as development accelerates, reducing natural cooling in the areas that need it most.

### Severe Storms and Tornadoes
Middle Tennessee sits squarely in "Dixie Alley," and tornado risk is a defining feature of Nashville's climate. The March 3, 2020 tornado outbreak sent an EF-3 tornado directly through downtown Nashville and East Nashville, killing 25 people across the region and causing $1.6 billion in damages. The tornado carved a path 60 miles long, destroying neighborhoods in Germantown, East Nashville, and Donelson. Severe thunderstorm frequency has also increased, with Nashville experiencing 15% more days with damaging wind reports in the 2015-2024 decade compared to 2005-2014.

## Local Climate Action

Nashville adopted its first climate action plan—NashvilleNext Sustainability—in 2021, which was updated in 2023 as the Nashville Climate Action Plan. The plan targets an 80% reduction in community-wide emissions by 2050 from a 2014 baseline, with an interim 50% reduction by 2035. Nashville's municipal target is carbon neutrality by 2040.

Metro Nashville's Office of Sustainability launched the Nashville Sustainability Advisory Committee in 2022 to coordinate implementation. Key initiatives include retrofitting all metro-owned buildings (2.8 million square feet) with LED lighting and efficient HVAC by 2028, transitioning 50% of the metro vehicle fleet to electric by 2035, and expanding transit through the Choose How You Move plan approved by voters in 2024, which commits $3.1 billion to bus rapid transit, sidewalks, and bike infrastructure.

Nashville's stormwater program continues its nationally recognized floodplain buyout effort, having acquired over 500 repetitive-loss properties since 2010 at a cost of $180 million. The city updated its stormwater detention requirements in 2023, mandating that new development detain the first 1.5 inches of rainfall on-site—up from 1 inch previously.

## Regulations & Incentives

Tennessee lacks a state-level climate action plan or renewable portfolio standard, placing more responsibility on cities to drive climate action. However, the Tennessee Valley Authority (TVA), which provides Nashville's electricity, has committed to reducing carbon emissions 70% by 2030 from a 2005 baseline and achieving net-zero by 2050.

Nashville Electric Service (NES) offers a Green Invest program allowing commercial customers to purchase renewable energy credits and a distributed solar program with net metering up to 100 kW. TVA's Generation Flexibility program provides incentives for demand response.

Metro Nashville's stormwater fee provides credits for green infrastructure installations. The city's building code was updated in 2022 to adopt the 2021 International Energy Conservation Code (IECC), improving energy efficiency standards for new construction. Davidson County's property assessor provides a green certification incentive that freezes assessed values for 5 years on buildings achieving LEED Gold or equivalent.

## Federal Funding Opportunities

Tennessee's IRA allocation for Home Energy Rebates totals $153 million. Nashville residents can access up to $8,000 for heat pump installations and $14,000 for income-qualified households through HEEHR. Federal tax credits for solar (30%), battery storage (30%), and efficiency improvements are available through 2032.

FEMA's BRIC program has been critical for Nashville's flood mitigation. The city has received over $45 million in combined BRIC, Hazard Mitigation Grant Program, and Flood Mitigation Assistance funding since 2020, primarily for property acquisitions along Sevenmile Creek and Whites Creek. The $1 billion annual BRIC allocation remains Nashville's largest federal resilience funding source.

The DOT's RAISE program awarded Nashville $24.6 million in 2023 for the Murfreesboro Pike Complete Streets project, which integrates green stormwater infrastructure with transit and pedestrian improvements. The EPA's Climate Pollution Reduction Grants provided Tennessee with planning funds, and implementation grants of up to $500 million are available competitively. USDA's $1.5 billion Urban Forestry program supports Nashville's tree canopy restoration goals.
