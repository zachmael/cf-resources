## Climate Snapshot

Washington, DC — home to 690,000 residents and the seat of the federal government — sits at the tidal head of the Potomac River, with much of its monumental core built on reclaimed marshland. The city's unique position as both a local government and a global symbol amplifies the stakes of climate resilience: flooding at the National Mall or power outages at federal buildings carry consequences far beyond municipal boundaries.

DC has warmed roughly 2°F since 1970. The summer of 2024 brought 35 days above 90°F, with heat indices regularly exceeding 110°F in neighborhoods east of the Anacostia River. Flash flooding hit the Metro system repeatedly — the July 2024 deluge shut down five stations and stranded thousands of commuters. In September 2023, a stalled frontal system dumped 5 inches of rain in three hours on Northwest DC, flooding I-295, Rock Creek Parkway, and hundreds of basement apartments.

The Potomac and Anacostia Rivers define DC's flood geography. Combined sewer overflows discharge an estimated 2 billion gallons of untreated sewage and stormwater into these waterways annually during heavy rain events, a problem the $2.7 billion Clean Rivers Project is designed to address by 2030.

## Top Climate Risks

### Inland & Riverine Flooding

FEMA's National Risk Index places DC in the 96th percentile for flood risk nationally. The city's combined sewer system — serving roughly one-third of the District — overwhelms during storms exceeding 0.5 inches per hour. Rock Creek, Watts Branch, and the Anacostia tributaries flash-flood with minimal warning. Wards 7 and 8, east of the Anacostia, face the highest flood risk and house the city's most economically vulnerable populations.

### Extreme Heat

DC's heat island effect raises urban core temperatures 5–10°F above surrounding suburbs. The District averages 35 heat advisory days per year, projected to reach 60 by 2050 (Union of Concerned Scientists, 2019). Heat disproportionately affects Wards 5, 7, and 8, where tree canopy coverage is 30–40% lower than in Wards 2 and 3. Heat-related mortality in the DC metro area averages 30+ deaths annually.

### Sea Level Rise & Tidal Influence

While DC sits roughly 100 miles from the ocean, tidal influence on the Potomac extends well past the District. The Washington Channel and Southwest Waterfront areas experience tidal flooding during nor'easters and hurricane remnants. NOAA projects 1–2.5 feet of additional tidal rise at DC by 2060, which would put portions of the Wharf, East Potomac Park, and Reagan National Airport at risk during high-tide storm events.

## Local Climate Action

DC's Climate Ready DC plan (2016, updated 2022) and the Clean Energy DC Omnibus Act (2018) establish some of the nation's most aggressive municipal climate targets: 100% renewable electricity by 2032 and carbon neutrality by 2045. The District's Building Energy Performance Standards (BEPS), enacted in 2021, require all large buildings (over 25,000 square feet) to meet energy performance targets on a five-year compliance cycle starting in 2026 — the first such mandate of its kind in the United States.

The Sustainable DC 2.0 plan (2019) outlines 43 actions across energy, transportation, waste, and nature. DC's solar capacity has grown from 38 MW in 2018 to over 200 MW in 2025. The city banned single-use plastic bags and expanded its Capital Bikeshare system to over 700 stations. DC Water's Clean Rivers Project — a massive tunnel system designed to capture combined sewer overflows — is the city's single largest resilience infrastructure investment.

The Department of Energy and Environment (DOEE) administers RiverSmart programs that fund green roofs, rain gardens, permeable pavers, and tree planting on private property, disbursing roughly $5 million annually.

## Regulations & Incentives

DC's BEPS program is the most consequential regulation for commercial building owners, requiring median Energy Star scores or equivalent performance metrics by compliance deadlines that begin in 2026. Failure to comply triggers escalating fines. The Green Building Act requires LEED Gold or equivalent for all new commercial construction over 10,000 square feet.

The DC Renewable Portfolio Standard requires 100% of electricity from renewable sources by 2032, with a 10% solar carve-out. The Solar for All program provides no-cost solar installations for income-qualified residents, funded by a surcharge on electricity bills. DC's Zero Emission Vehicle mandate mirrors California's Advanced Clean Cars II standards, phasing out new gas vehicle sales by 2035.

Federal employees and contractors can access GSA's Green Proving Ground program and DOE's Federal Energy Management Program for building retrofits. The IRA's tax credits — 30% ITC for solar, up to $5/sq ft for 179D commercial efficiency deductions — are heavily utilized by DC's large commercial and institutional building stock.

## Federal Funding Opportunities

DC's proximity to federal agencies creates unique access to resilience funding. FEMA's BRIC program awarded DC $8 million in FY2023 for flood risk reduction along the Anacostia. The EPA's $2.6 billion Water Infrastructure Finance and Innovation Act (WIFIA) program has provided loans for the Clean Rivers Project.

The IRA's $27 billion Greenhouse Gas Reduction Fund allocated significant capital through the DC Green Bank and the Coalition for Green Capital. The Department of Energy's Weatherization Assistance Program supports low-income building retrofits across the District. HUD's CDBG-DR funds are available following presidential disaster declarations.

The Federal Highway Administration's PROTECT formula program provides dedicated resilience funding for transportation infrastructure, directly relevant to DC's Metro and bridge network. The National Capital Planning Commission coordinates resilience planning for federal properties, creating partnership opportunities for private-sector consultants.

## How Council Fire Can Help

Council Fire's Annapolis headquarters and long-standing relationships with federal agencies — including NOAA, the U.S. Army, and multiple Congressional offices — position us uniquely for DC engagements. Our team has supported federal sustainability mandates and understands the intersection of federal policy, District regulations, and private-sector compliance that defines DC's climate landscape.

For commercial property owners navigating BEPS, we provide building performance auditing, decarbonization roadmaps, and incentive optimization that reduces compliance costs. For federal contractors and agencies, we bring experience with Executive Order sustainability requirements and GSA green building standards. Our work with the Environmental Defense Fund on policy design informs our ability to help DC-based organizations shape — not just respond to — the regulatory environment.

## Frequently Asked Questions

### What are the biggest climate risks facing Washington, DC?

Inland flooding from overwhelmed combined sewers and flash-flooding tributaries, extreme urban heat (projected 60+ heat advisory days per year by 2050), and tidal flooding along the Potomac and Anacostia rivers. Wards 7 and 8 face disproportionate risk on all three fronts.

### Does Washington, DC have a climate action plan?

Yes. Climate Ready DC (2016, updated 2022) is the adaptation framework, while Clean Energy DC (2018) targets 100% renewable electricity by 2032 and carbon neutrality by 2045. DC's Building Energy Performance Standards, the first in the nation, require large buildings to meet energy targets starting in 2026.

### What federal funding is available for climate resilience in DC?

DC accesses FEMA BRIC grants, EPA WIFIA loans, IRA Greenhouse Gas Reduction Fund capital (via DC Green Bank), DOE Weatherization Assistance, HUD CDBG-DR, and FHWA PROTECT transportation resilience funds. The city received $8 million in BRIC funding in FY2023.

### What are DC's Building Energy Performance Standards?

DC BEPS require all buildings over 25,000 square feet to meet energy performance benchmarks on a rolling five-year cycle, beginning in 2026. Building owners must demonstrate improvement toward median Energy Star performance or face escalating fines. It is the first mandatory building performance standard of its kind in the U.S.
