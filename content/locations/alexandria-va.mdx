## Climate Snapshot

Alexandria, Virginia sits on the western bank of the Potomac River, just south of Washington, D.C., with a population of approximately 161,000. The city's low-lying waterfront geography—much of Old Town Alexandria sits barely above sea level—makes it acutely vulnerable to tidal flooding, storm surge, and sea-level rise. The Potomac River's tidal influence extends well into the city's historic core, and combined sewer systems amplify flood damage during heavy rain events.

In September 2024, the remnants of a tropical system dumped over 4 inches of rain in under three hours, flooding dozens of businesses along King Street and causing an estimated $12 million in property damage. The city has experienced a 30% increase in days with tidal flooding since 2000, according to NOAA tide gauge data at the Washington, D.C. station. Hurricane Isabel in 2003 pushed a 9.4-foot storm surge into Old Town, causing over $50 million in damages—a scenario climate models suggest could become more frequent as sea levels rise an additional 1.5 to 3 feet by 2070.

Alexandria's humid subtropical climate also brings increasing heat stress. The city recorded 42 days above 90°F in 2023, well above the historical average of 28 days. Urban heat island effects push temperatures 5-8°F higher in dense corridors compared to surrounding suburban areas, disproportionately affecting low-income residents in neighborhoods like Arlandria.

## Top Climate Risks

### Coastal and Tidal Flooding
The Potomac River's tidal range and Alexandria's low elevation create persistent flood risk. NOAA data shows high-tide flooding events at the nearby Washington, D.C. gauge increased from 3 days per year in 2000 to 11 days in 2023. The city's 2021 Flood Action Alexandria plan identified 1,200 properties in the 100-year floodplain, with replacement value exceeding $1.8 billion. Sea-level rise projections of 2.1 feet by 2060 (intermediate scenario) would push regular tidal flooding into areas currently considered safe, threatening the $300 million waterfront redevelopment district.

### Extreme Heat
Alexandria recorded its hottest summer on record in 2023, with average temperatures 3.2°F above the 1991-2020 baseline. Heat-related emergency room visits in the city increased 45% between 2018 and 2023. The city's aging housing stock—over 40% of units were built before 1970—often lacks adequate insulation and modern HVAC systems, leaving vulnerable populations exposed. Cooling degree days have increased 22% since 2000, driving up energy costs for residents.

### Intense Precipitation and Stormwater Overflow
Alexandria's combined sewer system, which handles both stormwater and wastewater, overflows during heavy rain events. The city experienced 48 combined sewer overflow events in 2022 alone, discharging partially treated sewage into Four Mile Run and the Potomac River. Climate projections indicate a 15-20% increase in heavy precipitation events (defined as more than 2 inches in 24 hours) by 2050, worsening an already strained system. The AlexRenew wastewater authority estimated that full system separation would cost over $1.5 billion.

## Local Climate Action

Alexandria adopted its Environmental Action Plan 2040 in 2019, committing to carbon neutrality by 2040—one of the most aggressive targets in the region. Key milestones include a 50% reduction in community-wide greenhouse gas emissions by 2030 (from a 2005 baseline) and 100% renewable electricity for city operations by 2030. As of 2024, the city had achieved a 28% reduction from baseline.

The city's Green Building Policy requires all new construction over 5,000 square feet to meet LEED Silver or equivalent standards. In 2023, Alexandria passed an electrification-ready ordinance requiring new residential buildings to include electrical panel capacity for full electrification, even if gas appliances are initially installed.

Flood Action Alexandria, launched in 2021, is a $205 million capital improvement program targeting flood mitigation infrastructure along the waterfront, including tide gates, pump stations, and a flood wall system protecting the Old Town business district. Phase 1 construction began in early 2025.

## Regulations & Incentives

Virginia's Clean Economy Act (2020) requires Dominion Energy to achieve 100% carbon-free electricity by 2045 and mandates 16,100 MW of solar and onshore wind development. Alexandria residents benefit from Dominion's net metering program and the state's property tax exemption for solar installations.

The city offers a stormwater management fee credit of up to 50% for properties that install green infrastructure (rain gardens, permeable pavers, green roofs). Alexandria's EcoCity program provides free energy audits for residents and small businesses, along with rebates of up to $3,000 for heat pump installations through its partnership with the Virginia Energy Efficiency Council.

Virginia's Flood Risk Reduction Grant Program, established in 2022, provides matching funds to localities for flood mitigation projects, with Alexandria receiving $4.2 million in its first two funding cycles.

## Federal Funding Opportunities

The Inflation Reduction Act (IRA) provides significant funding streams relevant to Alexandria's climate goals. The Home Energy Rebate Programs offer up to $8,000 per household for heat pump installation and up to $14,000 total for low-income households through the High-Efficiency Electric Home Rebate Act (HEEHR). Virginia's allocation under these programs totals $340 million.

FEMA's Building Resilient Infrastructure and Communities (BRIC) program awarded $6.8 million to Alexandria in 2023 for flood mitigation planning and infrastructure. The city is eligible for additional BRIC funding in the 2025 cycle, with the national program allocation at $1 billion annually.

The EPA's Climate Pollution Reduction Grants provided the Northern Virginia region with $3 million in planning funds, with implementation grants of up to $500 million available through competitive application. Alexandria's waterfront resilience projects also qualify for Army Corps of Engineers Section 103 (Hurricane and Storm Damage Reduction) funding, with the Corps completing a feasibility study for Potomac River flood risk management in 2024.

HUD's Community Development Block Grant—Disaster Recovery (CDBG-DR) funding remains available for eligible flood-damaged properties, and the city has accessed $2.1 million in previous CDBG allocations for stormwater infrastructure improvements.

## Frequently Asked Questions

### What are the biggest climate risks facing Alexandria?
Alexandria faces three primary climate risks: tidal and coastal flooding from the Potomac River (worsened by sea-level rise projections of 2+ feet by 2060), extreme heat (42 days above 90°F recorded in 2023, with urban heat island effects adding 5-8°F in dense areas), and stormwater system overflows during increasingly intense rainstorms. The city's historic waterfront district and aging combined sewer system are particularly vulnerable.

### Does Alexandria have a climate action plan?
Yes. Alexandria adopted its Environmental Action Plan 2040 in 2019, targeting carbon neutrality by 2040 and a 50% emissions reduction by 2030. The city also launched Flood Action Alexandria in 2021, a $205 million infrastructure program to protect the waterfront from flooding. Alexandria requires LEED Silver or equivalent for new construction and passed an electrification-ready building ordinance in 2023.

### What federal funding is available for climate resilience in Virginia?
Virginia communities can access IRA Home Energy Rebates (up to $14,000 per low-income household from a $340 million state allocation), FEMA BRIC grants ($1 billion annual national program), EPA Climate Pollution Reduction Grants (up to $500 million per implementation grant), and Army Corps of Engineers flood risk reduction funding. Virginia's own Flood Risk Reduction Grant Program provides additional state-level matching funds.

### How is sea-level rise affecting Alexandria?
NOAA data shows high-tide flooding days have nearly quadrupled since 2000 at the nearest monitoring station. Under intermediate projections, sea levels could rise 2.1 feet by 2060, putting over 1,200 properties worth $1.8 billion at risk of regular flooding. The city's $205 million Flood Action Alexandria program is designed to address this through tide gates, pump stations, and flood barriers.

### What incentives are available for Alexandria homeowners to improve energy efficiency?
Alexandria homeowners can access federal IRA rebates (up to $8,000 for heat pumps), the city's EcoCity rebate program (up to $3,000 for heat pump installations), Virginia's solar property tax exemption, Dominion Energy net metering, and stormwater fee credits of up to 50% for installing green infrastructure on their property.
