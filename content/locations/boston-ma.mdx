## Climate Snapshot

Boston is home to roughly 675,000 residents packed into 89 square miles along Massachusetts Bay. The city sits on a coastline shaped by centuries of landfill—Back Bay, the Seaport District, and East Boston all rest on reclaimed land that now faces accelerating sea-level rise. With over $100 billion in assessed property value within the coastal flood zone, Boston ranks among the most financially exposed cities in the United States.

The region has already felt the sting. In January 2018, a nor'easter combined with an astronomical high tide to produce a water level of 15.16 feet at Boston Harbor—the highest since the Blizzard of 1978. The Seaport District flooded, cars were submerged on Long Wharf, and damages across the metro topped $20 million. Hurricane-force storms in 2021 and 2024 brought additional coastal and inland flooding, reinforcing what climate models project: by 2050, a 1-in-100-year flood event could occur every few years.

Boston also contends with rising temperatures. The city recorded 24 days above 90°F in 2022, roughly double the historical average. Urban heat islands in neighborhoods like Roxbury, Dorchester, and Mattapan push local temperatures 5–10°F above surrounding areas, disproportionately affecting communities of color and low-income residents.

## Top Climate Risks

### Coastal and Inland Flooding

Sea levels in Boston Harbor have risen approximately 11 inches since 1950 and are projected to increase another 9–21 inches by 2050. The city's 47 miles of coastline include significant portions of filled land with aging stormwater infrastructure. FEMA's updated flood maps place roughly 10% of Boston's land area in the Special Flood Hazard Area, including critical infrastructure like the Blue Line tunnels, Amtrak's Back Bay corridor, and Logan International Airport. A 2070 storm surge scenario could cause $94 billion in direct property damage citywide.

### Extreme Heat

Boston's average annual temperature has increased 3.3°F since 1970. Projections show 40–60 days above 90°F by 2070 under a high-emissions scenario, up from a historical average of 11. Heat-related emergency department visits in Boston tripled between 2015 and 2023. Neighborhoods with the least tree canopy—Chinatown, East Boston, and parts of Dorchester—face the most severe exposure, with surface temperatures exceeding surrounding areas by up to 15°F during peak summer.

### Severe Storms and Nor'easters

The Northeast has seen a 55% increase in heavy precipitation events since 1958. Boston's aging combined sewer system, which serves roughly one-third of the city, overflows during intense rain, sending untreated sewage into Boston Harbor and the Charles River. The September 2023 storm that dropped 8.7 inches of rain on metro Boston in 6 hours overwhelmed drainage capacity across multiple neighborhoods and caused an estimated $50 million in damages.

## Local Climate Action

Boston's Climate Action Plan, updated in 2019 as "Carbon Free Boston," commits the city to carbon neutrality by 2050. Key milestones include a 50% reduction in greenhouse gas emissions by 2030 (from a 2005 baseline) and net-zero new construction by 2030. The city's Building Emissions Reduction and Disclosure Ordinance (BERDO 2.0), passed in 2021, requires buildings over 20,000 square feet to meet declining emissions targets starting in 2025, with net-zero compliance by 2050.

The Climate Ready Boston initiative, launched in 2016, has invested over $30 million in neighborhood-specific resilience plans covering East Boston, Charlestown, Downtown, and South Boston. These plans identify site-specific interventions—elevated parks, flood barriers, green infrastructure—and prioritize projects that protect vulnerable populations.

Boston also joined the C40 Cities network and adopted a Green New Deal resolution in 2020, directing municipal investment toward equitable decarbonization and resilience.

## Regulations & Incentives

Massachusetts has some of the most aggressive climate regulations in the country. The 2021 Climate Act mandates statewide emissions reductions of 50% by 2030 and 75% by 2040 relative to 1990 levels, with net-zero by 2050. The state's updated Stretch Energy Code, adopted by Boston, requires new construction to be electric-ready and meet high-performance envelope standards.

The Mass Save program provides rebates of up to $10,000 for whole-home electrification, including heat pumps, insulation, and weatherization. Commercial properties can access incentives covering 50–100% of energy audit costs and up to $200,000 for comprehensive energy retrofits. Boston's Property Assessed Clean Energy (PACE) financing program allows commercial building owners to finance resilience and efficiency upgrades through property tax assessments.

The state's Solar Massachusetts Renewable Target (SMART) program offers declining block incentives for solar installations, with adders for low-income housing, community solar, and energy storage.

## Federal Funding Opportunities

The Inflation Reduction Act (IRA) makes substantial funding available to Boston-area projects. The High-Efficiency Electric Home Rebate Act (HEEHRA) provides up to $14,000 per household for electrification upgrades, with enhanced benefits for low- and moderate-income households. The Greenhouse Gas Reduction Fund allocated $27 billion nationally for green banks and clean energy financing, with Massachusetts receiving significant allocations through the EPA's National Clean Investment Fund.

FEMA's Building Resilient Infrastructure and Communities (BRIC) program awarded Massachusetts $18.7 million in its 2023 cycle. Boston's coastal resilience projects—particularly the Moakley Park redesign ($122 million) and East Boston waterfront improvements—have leveraged BRIC and Flood Mitigation Assistance (FMA) grants. The Army Corps of Engineers' Boston Harbor Flood Risk Management Study, authorized at $202 million, is evaluating harbor-wide barrier systems.

HUD's Community Development Block Grant–Disaster Recovery (CDBG-DR) and the DOT's PROTECT formula program also provide funding streams for climate-adaptive infrastructure in the Boston metro.

## Frequently Asked Questions

### What are the biggest climate risks facing Boston?

Coastal flooding tops the list. Boston's extensive filled land, aging infrastructure, and accelerating sea-level rise put billions in property and critical systems at risk. Extreme heat is a growing threat, particularly in environmental justice neighborhoods with limited tree canopy. Severe storms, including nor'easters and heavy rainfall events, overwhelm drainage systems and cause recurring flood damage inland.

### Does Boston have a climate action plan?

Yes. Boston's Carbon Free Boston plan targets carbon neutrality by 2050, with a 50% emissions reduction by 2030. The Climate Ready Boston initiative focuses on physical resilience, with neighborhood-specific adaptation plans and over $30 million in investments to date. BERDO 2.0 requires large buildings to meet declining emissions standards starting in 2025.

### What federal funding is available for climate resilience in Massachusetts?

Massachusetts benefits from FEMA BRIC and Flood Mitigation Assistance grants, IRA rebates and tax credits for building electrification and renewable energy, Army Corps flood risk management studies, and EPA funding through the Greenhouse Gas Reduction Fund. The state received $18.7 million in BRIC funding in 2023 alone, and individual projects like the Moakley Park redesign have secured over $100 million in combined federal and local investment.

### How does Boston's BERDO 2.0 affect building owners?

Buildings over 20,000 square feet must report emissions annually and meet progressively stricter carbon targets through 2050. Non-compliant buildings face fines. Owners can comply through energy efficiency retrofits, electrification, renewable energy procurement, or purchasing carbon offsets (with limitations). Council Fire helps building owners develop cost-effective compliance strategies.
