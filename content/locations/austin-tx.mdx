## Climate Snapshot

Austin, Texas, with a population of 1 million in the city and 2.3 million in the metro area, sits on the Balcones Escarpment where the Texas Hill Country meets the Blackland Prairie. This geographic boundary produces some of the most intense flash flooding in the United States—the region is often called "Flash Flood Alley." The combination of steep terrain, thin soils over limestone, and explosive thunderstorms funnels runoff into narrow creek channels with devastating speed.

Austin's growth has been staggering—the metro added nearly 1 million people between 2010 and 2024, creating development pressure on flood-prone land and straining water and power infrastructure. The February 2021 Winter Storm Uri exposed these vulnerabilities catastrophically. Austin Energy lost 40% of its generating capacity during a week of sub-zero temperatures, leaving hundreds of thousands without power, heat, or water. The storm caused an estimated $195 billion in damages across Texas, with Austin's water system sustaining $14 billion in pipe bursts and treatment facility failures.

Extreme heat is Austin's most persistent climate threat. The summer of 2023 set records: 45 consecutive days above 100°F, surpassing the previous record of 27 set in 2011. ERCOT, the state's electric grid operator, declared multiple emergency alerts as Austin Energy's peak demand exceeded capacity.

## Top Climate Risks

### Extreme Heat

Austin has experienced a 3.5°F increase in average annual temperature since 1970. Days above 100°F are projected to increase from a historical average of 12 to 40–60 by 2050. The 2023 heat season killed at least 200 people statewide and sent thousands to emergency rooms. Austin's urban heat island pushes temperatures in East Austin, Rundberg, and North Lamar 8–12°F above cooler areas along the Barton Creek greenbelt. Neighborhoods with the highest heat exposure correlate closely with historic patterns of segregation and disinvestment.

### Flash Flooding

The Balcones Escarpment creates ideal conditions for catastrophic flash floods. Thunderstorms moving off the Hill Country can drop 6–10 inches of rain in hours on steep, impervious terrain. The Halloween Flood of 2013 inundated Onion Creek neighborhoods, destroying 700 homes and causing $200 million in damages. The May 2015 Memorial Day floods killed 12 people across Central Texas. Austin's rapid growth has increased impervious cover, accelerating runoff into channels that cannot contain it.

### Drought and Water Supply

Austin draws its water from the Colorado River of Texas, managed through a chain of Highland Lakes reservoirs. The 2011 drought—the worst single-year drought in Texas history—dropped Lake Travis to 37% capacity and triggered mandatory water restrictions. Long-term climate projections show declining rainfall and increasing evaporation in Central Texas, tightening the supply-demand balance as the metro continues to grow. Austin Water estimates that demand could exceed supply by 2040 without significant conservation and new supply development.

## Local Climate Action

Austin's Climate Equity Plan (2021) targets net-zero community-wide emissions by 2040—the most aggressive timeline of any major Texas city. The plan centers racial equity, directing climate investments toward historically underserved communities. Key strategies include transitioning Austin Energy to 80% renewable by 2027 and 100% carbon-free by 2035, achieving net-zero energy buildings for all new construction by 2030, and reducing vehicle miles traveled 20% by 2030.

Austin Energy, the nation's eighth-largest municipal utility, has a robust renewable portfolio—over 50% renewable as of 2023—anchored by wind power purchase agreements and growing solar and battery storage capacity. The utility's Value of Solar tariff and community solar programs make distributed energy accessible to renters and low-income customers.

The city's Watershed Protection Department manages a $150 million buyout program that has acquired and demolished over 800 flood-prone properties along Onion Creek and other high-risk waterways since 1999.

## Regulations & Incentives

Texas lacks state climate mandates, but Austin's municipal authority provides significant regulatory lever. The Austin Energy Green Building Program, established in 1991, was the nation's first green building program and rates all new construction on a sustainability scale. The city's updated Energy Code (2024) requires electric-ready construction and exceeds state minimums for efficiency.

Austin's floodplain regulations are among the most restrictive in Texas, prohibiting new residential construction in the 100-year floodplain and requiring compensatory storage for any fill. The city's watershed protection ordinance limits impervious cover in environmentally sensitive areas.

Austin Energy offers rebates up to $3,500 for heat pump HVAC, $1,000 for heat pump water heaters, and commercial programs covering 50% of efficiency retrofit costs. Texas PACE enables commercial financing for energy and resilience upgrades. The state's property tax exemption for solar and wind supports distributed renewable deployment.

## Federal Funding Opportunities

IRA incentives are transformative in Austin's fast-growing market. HEEHRA rebates up to $14,000, 30% solar ITC, and clean vehicle credits align with Austin's electrification goals. EPA Greenhouse Gas Reduction Fund financing supports clean energy deployment in underserved neighborhoods.

FEMA BRIC awarded Texas $19.6 million in 2023. Austin's flood buyout program and watershed protection projects have successfully leveraged FEMA HMGP and FMA funding. HUD CDBG-DR allocations following Winter Storm Uri support infrastructure hardening.

DOE's Grid Resilience and Innovation Partnerships (GRIP) program funds grid modernization and battery storage deployment—directly relevant to Austin Energy's transition. DOT PROTECT formula funding supports climate-resilient transportation infrastructure.

## Frequently Asked Questions

### What are the biggest climate risks facing Austin?

Extreme heat is Austin's most persistent threat, with 45 consecutive days above 100°F in 2023 and projections for significantly more. Flash flooding in "Flash Flood Alley" can be catastrophic, as the 2013 and 2015 events demonstrated. Drought and water supply constraints threaten the city's long-term growth, and grid vulnerability (exposed by Winter Storm Uri) compounds every other risk.

### Does Austin have a climate action plan?
