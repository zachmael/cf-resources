## Climate Snapshot

Denver sits at 5,280 feet on the western edge of the Great Plains, with the Front Range of the Rocky Mountains rising immediately to the west. The city's population has surged past 715,000, with the metro area exceeding 2.9 million—growth that has intensified development in the wildland-urban interface and strained an already tight water supply. Denver's semi-arid climate receives just 15 inches of precipitation annually, and nearly all of the metro area's water originates as mountain snowpack.

The December 30, 2021, Marshall Fire in Boulder County—just 20 miles northwest of Denver—destroyed 1,084 homes and became the most destructive wildfire in Colorado history, causing over $2 billion in damages. It burned through suburban neighborhoods in a matter of hours, driven by 100-mph winds. The fire underscored that wildfire risk in Colorado isn't confined to mountain forests. In the summer of 2023, wildfire smoke from Canadian fires pushed Denver's AQI above 200 for multiple days, prompting air quality alerts and school activity restrictions.

Denver's average temperature has risen 3°F since 1970—one of the fastest warming rates among major U.S. cities. The city now averages 45 days per year above 90°F, up from 30 in the 1990s. Meanwhile, Colorado River water allocations face unprecedented cuts, and Front Range water providers are planning for a future with 10-30% less supply.

## Top Climate Risks

### Water Scarcity
Denver Water, the city's primary utility, serves 1.5 million people and depends on a snowpack-fed system that is becoming less reliable. Colorado River compact negotiations have forced the state to accept reduced allocations, and the 2002 drought remains the worst in Denver's recorded history, drawing Gross Reservoir to 30% capacity. Denver Water's $500 million Gross Reservoir expansion is underway to add 77,000 acre-feet of storage, but demand-side management will also be critical as the metro adds an estimated 500,000 residents by 2040.

### Wildfire and Smoke
Colorado's wildfire season has expanded by 40 days since the 1970s. The state experienced three of its four largest fires in recorded history during 2020 alone—Cameron Peak, East Troublesome, and Pine Gulch—burning a combined 540,000 acres. Smoke from these fires and distant burns regularly degrades Front Range air quality. The Marshall Fire demonstrated that grassland fires in suburban corridors can be as destructive as forest fires. Insurance rates along the Front Range have increased 30-50% since 2020.

### Extreme Heat and Hailstorms
Denver's elevation and dry air amplify temperature swings, and the city's rapid loss of irrigated green space to development intensifies urban heat. Hailstorms are an outsized risk—Colorado leads the nation in insured hail losses, with metro Denver alone accounting for $2.8 billion in hail damage in 2023 alone. A single storm in May 2017 caused $2.3 billion in damages across the metro.

## Local Climate Action

Denver's 80x50 Climate Action Plan, updated in 2023, targets 65% greenhouse gas reduction by 2030 and net-zero by 2040—an accelerated timeline from the original 2050 target. The plan emphasizes building electrification, transportation mode shift, and renewable energy procurement.

The city's Energize Denver Ordinance requires buildings over 25,000 square feet to meet energy performance targets, with escalating standards through 2030. Non-compliant buildings face fines starting at $2 per square foot. Denver also adopted a Green Buildings Ordinance requiring new construction to be electric-ready and solar-ready starting in 2025.

Denver's Office of Climate Action, Sustainability, and Resiliency (CASR) coordinates the Climate Protection Fund, which generates $36 million annually through a dedicated sales tax for climate programs. Funded initiatives include EV charging infrastructure, building electrification rebates, and urban tree planting.

## Regulations & Incentives

Colorado's Greenhouse Gas Pollution Reduction Roadmap targets a 50% reduction below 2005 levels by 2030 and 90% by 2050. The state's Energy Code Board adopted the 2021 IECC with electric-ready provisions. Xcel Energy, the primary utility, committed to 80% carbon reduction by 2030 and offers rebates of up to $4,500 for heat pump installations and $700 for heat pump water heaters.

Denver's Climate Protection Fund provides rebates of $3,000-$12,000 for residential building electrification, income-qualified weatherization, and EV charger installation. The state's PACE program enables commercial properties to finance clean energy improvements through property assessments. Colorado's Property Tax Exemption for Renewable Energy Equipment exempts the value of solar and wind installations from property tax assessments.

## Federal Funding Opportunities

Colorado's IRA allocation through the Home Electrification and Appliance Rebates program totals approximately $93 million, with individual households eligible for up to $14,000. The Home Efficiency Rebates program provides up to $8,000 for whole-home improvements.

FEMA's BRIC program awarded Colorado $19.8 million in 2023, with priority projects in wildfire mitigation and defensible space. The Community Wildfire Defense Grant program, funded at $1 billion through the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law, provides grants up to $10 million for community wildfire protection plans and risk reduction.

The Bureau of Reclamation's WaterSMART program provides grants of $300,000-$5 million for water efficiency, conservation, and recycling projects—critical for Front Range water providers. The USDA's Urban and Community Forestry program allocated $1.5 billion nationally for urban tree planting through the IRA.

## How Council Fire Can Help

Council Fire works with Front Range communities to address the interconnected challenges of water scarcity, wildfire risk, and rapid growth. In Denver, we support building electrification compliance strategies, develop wildfire resilience plans for neighborhoods in the wildland-urban interface, and help water utilities and municipalities secure federal funding for conservation infrastructure. Our team has deep experience with BRIC grant applications, WaterSMART proposals, and community wildfire protection planning.

We also help Denver-area organizations navigate the Energize Denver Ordinance, identify cost-effective pathways to compliance, and stack local, state, and federal incentives to reduce the financial burden of decarbonization.

## Frequently Asked Questions

### What are the biggest climate risks facing Denver?
Water scarcity is Denver's most consequential long-term risk, as the city depends entirely on declining snowpack for its water supply. Wildfire and smoke pose immediate threats—the 2021 Marshall Fire destroyed over 1,000 homes just 20 miles from downtown. Extreme heat is intensifying, with days above 90°F increasing by 50% since the 1990s. Colorado also leads the nation in insured hail losses, with $2.8 billion in hail damage to metro Denver in 2023.

### Does Denver have a climate action plan?
Yes. Denver's 80x50 Climate Action Plan, updated in 2023, targets net-zero emissions by 2040. The city funds climate work through a dedicated sales tax generating $36 million annually. Key policies include the Energize Denver building performance ordinance, electric-ready new construction requirements, and building electrification rebates of up to $12,000 per household.

### What federal funding is available for climate resilience in Colorado?
Colorado has access to $93 million in IRA home electrification rebates, $19.8 million from FEMA BRIC (2023), and up to $10 million per project through the Community Wildfire Defense Grant program. The Bureau of Reclamation's WaterSMART grants fund water efficiency projects up to $5 million. Additional IRA funding supports urban forestry ($1.5 billion nationally) and clean energy tax credits.

### How does the Marshall Fire change wildfire planning for the Denver metro?
The Marshall Fire proved that suburban communities on Colorado's Front Range face direct wildfire risk, not just smoke exposure. It burned through grassland—not forest—in a densely populated corridor. This has prompted Boulder County and surrounding jurisdictions to update wildfire protection plans, revise building codes for fire-resistant construction, and invest in defensible space programs. Insurance markets have also responded, with premiums rising 30-50% for properties in fire-prone areas.
