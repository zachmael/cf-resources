## Climate Snapshot

Los Angeles, with 3.9 million residents in the city and 13 million in the metro, is the second-largest city in the United States. The city sprawls across 469 square miles from the Pacific coast into inland valleys, bordered by the Santa Monica and San Gabriel Mountains. This geography creates a wildfire-urban interface that puts hundreds of thousands of homes in direct fire path.

The January 2025 firestorm that devastated Pacific Palisades and Altadena killed at least 28 people, destroyed over 12,000 structures, and caused an estimated $250 billion in damages—making it the costliest wildfire disaster in U.S. history and one of the most expensive natural disasters ever recorded. The fires burned through neighborhoods that many considered urban, not wildland, challenging assumptions about where fire risk begins and ends.

Simultaneously, LA faces a water crisis. The city imports 85% of its water from the Sierra Nevada, Colorado River, and Northern California—all sources under increasing strain from drought and competing demand. The 2020–2022 drought was the driest three-year period in California's recorded history, dropping Colorado River reservoir levels to historic lows. Extreme heat compounds every other risk: in 2023, Woodland Hills in the San Fernando Valley reached 118°F.

## Top Climate Risks

### Wildfire and Post-Fire Hazards

The 2025 Palisades and Eaton fires demonstrated that wildfire risk in LA extends well beyond traditional wildland-urban interface zones. Over 1.2 million LA residents live in Very High Fire Hazard Severity Zones (VHFHSZ). Santa Ana wind events—hot, dry offshore winds that can exceed 80 mph—drive the most destructive fires. After fires strip hillsides of vegetation, winter rains trigger debris flows and mudslides. The January 2018 Montecito debris flow, triggered by rain falling on Thomas Fire burn scars, killed 23 people.

### Extreme Heat

LA County experiences an average of 6 extreme heat days per year, but projections show 22–54 such days by 2050. The San Fernando and San Gabriel Valleys already regularly exceed 110°F during heat waves. The September 2022 heat dome produced temperatures 20–30°F above normal across LA for 10 consecutive days, killing at least 395 people statewide. Communities in South LA, Pacoima, and Boyle Heights face the worst exposure due to limited tree canopy and aging housing stock.

### Water Supply and Drought

LA's imported water supply is structurally vulnerable. The Colorado River Compact, which allocates water among seven states, faces fundamental renegotiation as the basin produces 20% less runoff than historical averages. Sierra Nevada snowpack, which supplies the LA Aqueduct, declined 40% between 2000 and 2023. Climate models project continued drying, with the potential for megadroughts lasting 20+ years.

## Local Climate Action

LA's Green New Deal (updated in 2022 as the LA Climate Emergency Mobilization) targets carbon neutrality by 2035—tied with a handful of cities for the most aggressive timeline in the nation. Key targets include 100% renewable energy by 2035, 100% zero-emission vehicles in city fleet by 2028, and 100% electric new buildings by 2023 (achieved via updated building code).

LADWP, the nation's largest municipal utility, has committed $12.4 billion to retire all three of its remaining gas-fired power plants and replace them with wind, solar, and battery storage by 2035. The utility's Power Strategic Long-Term Resource Plan maps a pathway to 100% clean energy.

The city's Resilient Los Angeles Strategy addresses disaster preparedness, housing security, and economic resilience. Cool Streets LA has installed reflective pavement coatings in targeted neighborhoods to reduce surface temperatures by 10–15°F. The Urban Forest Management Plan aims to increase canopy coverage from 21% to 50% by 2028, prioritizing heat-burdened communities.

## Regulations & Incentives

California's climate regulations are the most comprehensive in the country. AB 1279 mandates statewide carbon neutrality by 2045. The state's ban on new gas vehicle sales takes effect in 2035. Title 24 building standards require solar and electric-ready construction. The cap-and-trade program generates $2–3 billion annually for the Greenhouse Gas Reduction Fund.

LA's local regulations include the city's Existing Buildings Energy Performance Ordinance (EBEP), requiring commercial buildings to benchmark and disclose energy use, with performance standards phasing in through 2035. The city's gas ban for new construction took effect in 2023. LADWP offers robust incentives: up to $4,500 for residential solar, $3,000 for battery storage, $2,000 for heat pump HVAC, and aggressive commercial lighting and HVAC programs.

SoCal Gas and LADWP rebate programs stack with IRA federal incentives, creating significant savings for whole-home electrification and commercial energy retrofits.

## Federal Funding Opportunities

The 2025 LA wildfires triggered a major disaster declaration, unlocking FEMA Individual Assistance, Public Assistance, and Hazard Mitigation Grant Program (HMGP) funds. CDBG-DR allocations for the wildfire recovery are expected to exceed $10 billion. The SBA disaster loan program activated for affected businesses and homeowners.

Beyond disaster response, IRA incentives are transformative in LA's market. HEEHRA rebates, 30% solar and storage ITCs, and clean vehicle credits align with LA's aggressive electrification timeline. EPA Greenhouse Gas Reduction Fund awards to California entities exceeded $6 billion.

FEMA BRIC has funded wildfire mitigation projects in LA County, including vegetation management and structure hardening programs. The USDA's Community Wildfire Defense Grant program provides additional funding for wildfire-adapted communities. DOT PROTECT funds climate-resilient transportation infrastructure.

## How Council Fire Can Help

Los Angeles faces climate risks of extraordinary scope—from wildfire and heat to drought and seismic hazard. Council Fire helps property owners, communities, and agencies build resilience across this full spectrum.

For wildfire recovery and rebuilding, Council Fire provides fire-adapted design guidance, FEMA and CDBG-DR application support, and resilient reconstruction planning. For building owners navigating LA's electrification mandates, we deliver decarbonization roadmaps and incentive optimization that stacks LADWP, state, and federal programs.

Our water resilience practice supports rainwater harvesting, greywater systems, and drought-adapted landscape design. Council Fire brings the cross-disciplinary expertise that LA's compounding climate challenges require—connecting the dots between fire, heat, water, and energy to build coherent resilience strategies.

## Frequently Asked Questions

### What are the biggest climate risks facing Los Angeles?

Wildfire is LA's most acute threat, as the 2025 fires demonstrated with $250 billion in damages. Extreme heat kills more people than any other weather hazard in the region. Water supply vulnerability, driven by declining snowpack and Colorado River shortfalls, threatens the city's long-term viability. These risks compound: drought dries vegetation, heat and Santa Ana winds drive fires, and post-fire landscapes flood in winter rains.

### Does Los Angeles have a climate action plan?

Yes. LA's Green New Deal targets carbon neutrality by 2035. The city has banned gas in new construction, committed to 100% renewable electricity by 2035 through LADWP's $12.4 billion investment plan, and adopted aggressive vehicle electrification targets. The Resilient Los Angeles Strategy addresses disaster preparedness and community resilience.

### What federal funding is available for climate resilience in California?

California receives the nation's largest FEMA BRIC allocation ($89 million in 2023). The 2025 wildfire disaster declaration unlocks billions in FEMA, CDBG-DR, and SBA funds. IRA incentives stack with state and local programs. EPA Greenhouse Gas Reduction Fund, USDA wildfire defense grants, and DOT PROTECT funding provide additional streams.

### How do I rebuild after a wildfire in LA?

Start with FEMA Individual Assistance registration and SBA disaster loan applications. Check CDBG-DR programs through the state for additional recovery grants. Council Fire helps homeowners navigate the rebuilding process with fire-adapted design, permit compliance, and insurance claim support. California's new WUI building standards require ignition-resistant construction in fire hazard zones.
