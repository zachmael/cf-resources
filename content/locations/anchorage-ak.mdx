## Climate Snapshot

Anchorage is Alaska's largest city (290,000 residents, roughly 40% of the state's population), situated on a coastal plain between the Chugach Mountains and Cook Inlet at 61° North latitude. The city is warming faster than virtually any major U.S. metro—average temperatures have risen approximately 4°F since the 1970s, with winter temperatures increasing even more dramatically. The 2019 heat wave saw Anchorage reach 90°F for the first time in recorded history.

Alaska is warming at twice the global average rate, and the effects are visible everywhere: permafrost thaw is destabilizing infrastructure across the state, wildfire seasons are lengthening, glaciers are retreating at accelerating rates, and Cook Inlet's sea ice season has shortened by roughly 30 days since 1980. For Anchorage specifically, these changes are reshaping everything from road maintenance budgets to building foundation engineering to wildfire risk in the Hillside neighborhoods.

The city's economy depends on federal military spending (Joint Base Elmendorf-Richardson), oil and gas revenue, healthcare, and tourism. All face climate-related disruptions: the Trans-Alaska Pipeline's permafrost foundations are thawing in some sections, military installations are adapting facilities for changing conditions, and tourism patterns are shifting as glaciers recede and weather becomes less predictable.

## Top Climate Risks

### Permafrost Thaw & Ground Instability

While Anchorage proper sits in a discontinuous permafrost zone (less pervasive than northern Alaska), significant permafrost exists in shaded slopes, north-facing aspects, and areas with organic soil cover. Thawing permafrost causes differential settlement, damaging roads, building foundations, water lines, and sewer infrastructure. The Alaska Department of Transportation estimates that permafrost-related damage costs the state $50–100 million annually in road repairs. Anchorage's Hillside area and Government Hill neighborhood have experienced slope instability exacerbated by freeze-thaw cycles and thawing permafrost.

### Wildfire & Smoke

The 2019 Swan Lake Fire on the Kenai Peninsula produced weeks of hazardous air quality in Anchorage, and the city has experienced multiple wildfire evacuation alerts in recent years. Alaska's wildfire season has lengthened by 40 days since the 1980s, and the area burned annually has doubled. Anchorage's Hillside neighborhoods abut boreal forest with heavy fuel loads. Drought conditions—increasingly common as summer temperatures rise—elevate fire risk. Wildfire smoke now regularly produces Air Quality Index readings above 150 (unhealthy) for days to weeks during summer.

### Coastal Erosion & Cook Inlet Hazards

Cook Inlet's extreme tidal range (up to 38 feet—second largest in North America) and ice dynamics create unique coastal hazards. Erosion along the inlet's bluffs threatens the Alaska Railroad, the Seward Highway, and the Port of Alaska. The Port of Alaska modernization project ($1.8 billion) is rebuilding the city's primary fuel and cargo facility on an eroding shoreline. Reduced sea ice coverage increases wave energy and accelerates bluff erosion during fall and winter storms.

## Local Climate Action

The Municipality of Anchorage adopted its Climate Action Plan in 2019, setting a target of 80% greenhouse gas reduction by 2050 (from a 2008 baseline) and a community-wide goal of net-zero by 2070. Priority actions include building energy efficiency (buildings account for 55% of Anchorage's emissions due to heating demand), transportation electrification, and waste reduction.

Anchorage's building energy benchmarking ordinance (2022) requires commercial buildings over 25,000 sq ft to report annual energy use. The city has retrofitted municipal buildings with high-efficiency heating systems and LED lighting, targeting a 30% reduction in municipal energy use by 2030.

The Anchorage Wildfire Mitigation Program, expanded after the 2019 fire season, funds defensible space creation, fuel reduction treatments, and community wildfire protection plans for Hillside and Eagle River neighborhoods. Over 500 acres of fuel reduction work has been completed since 2020.

## Regulations & Incentives

Alaska's building code is locally adopted—Anchorage enforces the 2021 International Building Code with amendments for seismic and snow loading. Foundation design standards require geotechnical evaluation of permafrost conditions, with deep piling or thermosiphon systems required in permafrost areas.

Alaska's Renewable Energy Fund provides grants for renewable energy projects, with over $300 million invested since 2008. The Alaska Housing Finance Corporation offers weatherization assistance and Home Energy Rebate Program incentives of up to $10,000 for energy efficiency improvements—critical in a state where heating costs average $3,000–5,000 per household annually.

The Alaska Energy Authority administers the Power Cost Equalization program, which subsidizes electricity costs in rural communities but does not apply to Anchorage. Chugach Electric, Anchorage's primary utility, offers net metering for solar (which produces meaningful output during 19+ hours of summer daylight).

## Federal Funding Opportunities

The Bipartisan Infrastructure Law allocated $3.5 billion specifically for wildfire resilience, with Alaska eligible for hazardous fuels reduction and community wildfire defense grants through the USDA Forest Service.

The Army Corps of Engineers' Alaska District manages multiple coastal erosion and flood risk management projects, including the Port of Alaska modernization support. Section 117 of WRDA provides expedited authority for Alaska-specific projects.

The Denali Commission—a unique federal-state partnership for Alaska infrastructure—provides grants for rural energy, transportation, and community resilience projects, with annual appropriations of $15–30 million.

FEMA's BRIC program and Pre-Disaster Mitigation grants are available to the Municipality of Anchorage for seismic, wildfire, and flood mitigation. Alaska's high per-capita hazard exposure improves competitive positioning for these grants.

DOE's Weatherization Assistance Program and State Energy Program provide formula funding that Alaska directs toward residential energy efficiency—the state's cold climate and high energy costs make these programs especially impactful.

## How Council Fire Can Help

Council Fire brings climate adaptation expertise to Anchorage's unique Arctic-adjacent environment. We support municipal and state clients with hazard mitigation planning, wildfire resilience strategy, and infrastructure adaptation for permafrost and coastal erosion challenges.

Our energy and sustainability practice helps building owners reduce heating costs through deep retrofit planning, energy benchmarking compliance, and renewable energy integration. For military and federal facility clients, we provide installation resilience assessments addressing the intersection of seismic, wildfire, and permafrost risks that characterize south-central Alaska.

## Frequently Asked Questions

### How fast is Anchorage warming?

Anchorage has warmed approximately 4°F since the 1970s—roughly twice the rate of the Lower 48 average. Winter temperatures have increased even more (5–7°F), shortening the cold season by roughly 3 weeks. The 2019 heat wave, when Anchorage hit 90°F for the first time, was not an isolated event—the 2019 summer averaged 5°F above the long-term mean. Climate models project continued Arctic amplification, with Anchorage potentially experiencing winter temperatures 8–12°F warmer by 2070.

### Does permafrost affect Anchorage directly?

Yes, though less severely than northern Alaska. Anchorage sits in a discontinuous permafrost zone, meaning frozen ground exists in patches rather than continuously. North-facing slopes, shaded areas, and organic-rich soils in the Hillside and Government Hill areas contain permafrost that is actively thawing. This causes differential ground settlement, cracking roads and building foundations, and slope instability. New construction in these areas requires geotechnical investigation and engineered foundations.

### How does wildfire risk in Anchorage compare to the Lower 48?

Alaska's wildfire challenge is distinct: longer daylight hours, vast areas of boreal forest, and warming-driven drought are producing larger and more frequent fires. Anchorage's Hillside neighborhoods are within the wildland-urban interface, similar to communities in California or Colorado. However, Alaska's limited firefighting resources and vast distances make suppression more challenging. The Municipality has invested in defensible space, fuel breaks, and community wildfire protection plans, but risk is increasing as summers warm and dry.
