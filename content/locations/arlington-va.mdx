## Climate Snapshot

Arlington County, Virginia, directly across the Potomac River from Washington, D.C., is one of the smallest and most densely populated counties in the United States. With 240,000 residents packed into 26 square miles, Arlington combines dense urban corridors (Rosslyn, Ballston, Crystal City) with established residential neighborhoods—all served by aging infrastructure increasingly stressed by climate change.

Arlington's compact geography concentrates risk. The county's eastern edge runs along the Potomac River and Four Mile Run, a stream that drains 20 square miles of urbanized watershed and has flooded repeatedly. The September 2024 storm that dropped 4 inches of rain in 2 hours on the D.C. metro caused $15 million in damages in Arlington, flooding Four Mile Run neighborhoods, overwhelming storm drains in Columbia Pike, and inundating the lower levels of several Crystal City buildings.

Extreme heat is an emerging challenge in the urban corridor. Arlington's dense development and proximity to D.C.'s urban heat island produce summer temperatures 5–10°F above surrounding suburban areas. The July 2024 heat wave brought 12 consecutive days above 95°F, straining the power grid and sending dozens to emergency rooms. Arlington's large federal workforce—the Pentagon, DARPA, and dozens of agencies—makes infrastructure reliability a national security concern.

## Top Climate Risks

### Urban Flooding

Four Mile Run and its tributaries are Arlington's primary flood risk. The 17-square-mile watershed is 60% impervious, sending enormous volumes of runoff into a channel that was partially armored by the Army Corps in the 1970s but remains undersized for modern rainfall. The 100-year floodplain includes 2,400 structures with $2.1 billion in assessed value. Climate change is increasing the frequency of intense rainfall events—the D.C. metro has experienced a 40% increase in heavy precipitation since 1958. Localized street flooding from overwhelmed storm drains affects neighborhoods across the county during moderate storms.

### Extreme Heat

Arlington averages 36 days above 90°F, projected to reach 55–75 days by 2050. The county's dense urban core—high-rise corridors with limited tree canopy and extensive impervious surface—produces surface temperatures 10–15°F above residential neighborhoods. Outdoor workers, elderly residents in older apartment buildings, and transit users face the highest heat exposure. Peak electricity demand during heat waves strains Dominion Energy's distribution network.

### Potomac River Flooding and Sea-Level Rise

While Arlington sits above the tidal Potomac in most areas, its riverside parks, trails, and portions of Reagan National Airport are vulnerable to rising river levels. The Potomac at Georgetown has risen 11 inches since 1930. Extreme rainfall events upstream in the 14,700-square-mile Potomac watershed can produce rapid river rises that flood low-lying areas. The combination of sea-level rise (affecting tidal influence) and more intense upstream rainfall creates compound flood risk.

## Local Climate Action

Arlington's Community Energy Plan (2019, updated 2023) targets an 80% reduction in community-wide emissions by 2050, with carbon-neutral government operations by 2040. The plan prioritizes building energy, transportation, and community resilience.

The county's green building program requires LEED Silver or equivalent for all site plan developments. Arlington adopted a Commercial Building Energy Benchmarking ordinance in 2023, requiring large buildings to disclose energy performance. The county's electric vehicle strategy targets 25% EV adoption by 2030, supported by 500+ public charging stations.

Arlington's Stormwater Master Plan directs $200 million over 20 years toward drainage infrastructure upgrades, stream restoration, and green infrastructure deployment. The Four Mile Run Restoration Master Plan integrates flood risk reduction with habitat restoration and community recreation. The county's urban forestry program maintains 40% tree canopy and targets expansion in heat-burdened corridors.

## Regulations & Incentives

Virginia's Clean Economy Act mandates 100% carbon-free electricity by 2045. The state's Stretch Energy Code, which Arlington has adopted, requires high-performance building envelopes and electric-ready construction. Virginia's C-PACE program enables commercial energy efficiency and resilience financing.

Arlington's Chesapeake Bay Preservation Act compliance requires stormwater management for all development in Resource Protection Areas. The county's floodplain management ordinance mandates 1.5 feet of freeboard above base flood elevation. Arlington's stormwater utility fee funds drainage maintenance; credits up to 50% are available for on-site stormwater management.

Dominion Energy offers rebates for heat pumps, insulation, and smart thermostats. Virginia's solar property tax exemption and net metering policy support distributed renewable energy. Arlington's Solarize Arlington program provides group-purchasing discounts for residential solar installations.

## Federal Funding Opportunities

Arlington's proximity to the federal government provides unique access to resilience programs. IRA incentives—HEEHRA rebates up to $14,000, 30% solar ITC, and Greenhouse Gas Reduction Fund financing—stack with Virginia and Dominion programs.

FEMA BRIC awarded Virginia $22 million in 2023. Arlington's Four Mile Run flood mitigation projects compete strongly. The Army Corps' Four Mile Run study evaluates structural and nature-based flood risk reduction measures. EPA's Chesapeake Bay Program provides additional funding for stormwater management and water quality improvements.

DOE's Building Technologies Office programs support Arlington's commercial building benchmarking initiative. DOT PROTECT formula funding addresses climate-resilient transportation infrastructure—critical for Arlington's Metro-dependent commuter economy.

## How Council Fire Can Help

Arlington's dense, high-value built environment demands precision in resilience investment. Council Fire helps county agencies, commercial building owners, and federal facility managers align climate risk with available funding and regulatory requirements.

For commercial building owners facing benchmarking disclosure and Virginia's evolving building codes, Council Fire provides energy performance assessment, decarbonization planning, and incentive optimization. For county stormwater and flood management programs, we deliver federal grant strategy and benefit-cost analysis for BRIC, Army Corps, and EPA applications.

Our experience with federal facilities positions Council Fire to support Pentagon and agency resilience planning under DOD's Installation Energy and Environment framework. We help Arlington protect its critical assets—federal and local—in a rapidly changing climate.

## Frequently Asked Questions

### What are the biggest climate risks facing Arlington?

Urban flooding from overwhelmed storm drains and Four Mile Run is the most frequent climate hazard, with damages increasing as heavy rainfall events intensify. Extreme heat, amplified by Arlington's dense urban development, is a growing public health threat. Potomac River flooding affects riverside areas and Reagan National Airport.

### Does Arlington have a climate action plan?

Yes. Arlington's Community Energy Plan targets 80% emissions reduction by 2050 with carbon-neutral government operations by 2040. The county mandates green building standards, building energy benchmarking, and has invested $200 million in stormwater infrastructure. Tree canopy maintenance at 40% helps mitigate urban heat.

### What federal funding is available for climate resilience in Virginia?

Virginia received $22 million in FEMA BRIC funding in 2023. IRA rebates and tax credits stack with state and utility programs. Army Corps studies address Four Mile Run and Potomac River flood risk. EPA Chesapeake Bay Program funds stormwater management. DOT PROTECT supports climate-resilient transportation.
