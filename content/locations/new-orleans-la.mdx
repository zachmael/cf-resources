## Climate Snapshot

New Orleans, home to approximately 376,000 residents, sits in one of the most precarious geographic positions of any major American city. Nestled between the Mississippi River and Lake Pontchartrain, roughly half the city lies below sea level—some neighborhoods by as much as 8 feet. The metro area of 1.27 million people depends on a $14.5 billion hurricane risk reduction system of levees, floodwalls, and pumps completed after Hurricane Katrina.

Katrina remains the defining event. In August 2005, levee failures inundated 80% of the city, killed over 1,800 people across the Gulf Coast, and caused $125 billion in damages—the costliest natural disaster in U.S. history at the time. Sixteen years later, Hurricane Ida struck in August 2021 as a Category 4 storm, causing $75 billion in total damages. While the upgraded levee system held, Ida devastated areas outside the protection system, knocked out the city's entire power grid for days, and exposed the fragility of critical infrastructure.

Land subsidence continues at 1–2 inches per decade across much of the metro, compounding sea-level rise and reducing the effective height of flood protection. The Mississippi River Delta, which historically buffered the city from Gulf storms, has lost 2,000 square miles of wetlands since the 1930s—a rate of roughly one football field every 100 minutes.

## Top Climate Risks

### Hurricanes and Storm Surge

New Orleans sits in the crosshairs of Gulf of Mexico hurricanes. The $14.5 billion Hurricane and Storm Damage Risk Reduction System (HSDRRS) provides 100-year flood protection, but the system was designed for 2007 conditions. By 2057—when the Army Corps' authorized protection period expires—sea-level rise and subsidence will have reduced effective protection to roughly 50-year levels without further investment. A slow-moving Category 5 hurricane could overwhelm the system, with catastrophic consequences for a below-sea-level city.

### Subsidence and Sea-Level Rise

Relative sea-level rise in New Orleans combines global ocean rise (projected 1–2 feet by 2060 in the Gulf) with local subsidence. Parts of New Orleans East and Gentilly are sinking faster than others due to soil composition and groundwater withdrawal. This uneven subsidence cracks foundations, buckles roads, and undermines the drainage system. The city spends $250 million annually on drainage infrastructure maintenance—a figure that will grow as conditions worsen.

### Extreme Rainfall and Interior Flooding

New Orleans receives 64 inches of rain annually and relies on a system of canals and pumps (capacity: 29 billion gallons per day) to keep the city dry. The August 2017 flash flood event dropped 9 inches of rain in 3 hours, overwhelming pumps that were operating at only 50% capacity due to maintenance failures, and flooding 1,000+ homes. Even with fully operational pumps, rainfall exceeding 1 inch per hour outpaces drainage capacity in many neighborhoods.

## Local Climate Action

New Orleans' Climate Action Strategy for 2030, released in 2017, sets a target of 50% emissions reduction by 2030 relative to 2005 levels and net-zero by 2050. The plan emphasizes resilience co-benefits, linking energy efficiency and renewable energy deployment with reduced vulnerability during power outages.

The city's Resilience Strategy, developed through the 100 Resilient Cities partnership, integrates flood risk reduction with economic equity. The Gentilly Resilience District ($141 million) is a signature project combining green infrastructure, improved drainage, and community investment in one of the city's most flood-prone neighborhoods.

New Orleans' updated comprehensive plan (2022) restricts new residential development in the highest-risk areas and requires adaptive design standards for construction in flood-prone zones. The Sewerage & Water Board is investing $3.8 billion over 20 years to upgrade the city's aging water and drainage infrastructure.

## Regulations & Incentives

Louisiana's building code requires new construction in flood zones to meet FEMA standards with 1 foot of freeboard. Orleans Parish goes further, requiring elevation certificates and imposing additional construction standards in repetitive-loss areas. The state's Coastal Zone Management Program regulates development within the coastal zone to protect wetlands and natural flood buffers.

Louisiana offers a property tax exemption for solar installations and participates in federal tax credit programs. Entergy New Orleans, the local utility, provides rebates for energy efficiency upgrades including insulation, HVAC systems, and smart thermostats. The state's Resilient Louisiana Commission, established in 2022, coordinates resilience investments across parishes and connects communities with federal funding.

Louisiana's Community Development Block Grant–Disaster Recovery (CDBG-DR) program, administered through the state's Office of Community Development, has distributed over $14 billion in post-Katrina and post-Ida recovery and mitigation funds.

## Federal Funding Opportunities

Louisiana has received more federal disaster recovery and mitigation funding than nearly any other state. Post-Ida CDBG-DR allocations exceeded $3.2 billion. FEMA's BRIC program awarded Louisiana $28.3 million in 2023, with multiple Orleans Parish projects funded.

The Army Corps' ongoing Mississippi River and Tributaries project and the Louisiana Coastal Protection and Restoration Authority's (CPRA) $50 billion Coastal Master Plan represent generational investments in the region's survival. Federal cost-share for coastal restoration projects typically runs 65–85%.

IRA provisions benefit New Orleans significantly: HEEHRA rebates up to $14,000 per household, 30% solar ITC, and direct pay options for tax-exempt entities like the Sewerage & Water Board. The EPA's Greenhouse Gas Reduction Fund channels clean energy financing to underserved communities, directly applicable to New Orleans' low-income neighborhoods.

## How Council Fire Can Help

New Orleans operates in a funding environment of extraordinary complexity—layers of CDBG-DR, FEMA mitigation programs, Army Corps projects, state coastal restoration, and IRA incentives all intersect. Council Fire helps public agencies, utilities, and private sector clients navigate this landscape and maximize the return on resilience investments.

We support FEMA BRIC and FMA grant applications with benefit-cost analyses calibrated to New Orleans' unique risk profile. For the Sewerage & Water Board and other infrastructure agencies, Council Fire provides resilience planning and project management for critical system upgrades.

Our team's Gulf Coast experience spans green infrastructure design, building electrification, and nature-based solutions—connecting federal funding to projects that reduce flood risk, lower energy costs, and strengthen the communities that need it most. Council Fire helps New Orleans build forward, not just rebuild.

## Frequently Asked Questions

### What are the biggest climate risks facing New Orleans?

Hurricanes and storm surge are the existential threat—the city depends on a $14.5 billion levee system that will lose effectiveness over time without continued investment. Subsidence compounds sea-level rise, sinking some neighborhoods 1–2 inches per decade. Interior flooding from extreme rainfall events regularly overwhelms the city's pump-dependent drainage system.

### Does New Orleans have a climate action plan?

Yes. The Climate Action Strategy for 2030 targets 50% emissions reduction by 2030 and net-zero by 2050. The Resilience Strategy focuses on flood risk reduction, economic equity, and infrastructure investment. Signature projects include the $141 million Gentilly Resilience District and $3.8 billion in water and drainage system upgrades.

### What federal funding is available for climate resilience in Louisiana?

Louisiana accesses billions in CDBG-DR funds (over $3.2 billion post-Ida alone), FEMA BRIC and HMGP grants ($28.3 million in BRIC in 2023), Army Corps flood protection and coastal restoration projects, and IRA clean energy incentives. The state's $50 billion Coastal Master Plan receives significant federal cost-share.

### How does the New Orleans levee system work?

The HSDRRS consists of 350 miles of levees and floodwalls, 73 non-federal pump stations, and three massive surge barriers including the Inner Harbor Navigation Canal Surge Barrier—the largest in the world. The system was built to the 100-year flood standard after Katrina, but sea-level rise and subsidence will erode that protection level over time without continued upgrades.
