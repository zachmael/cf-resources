## Climate Snapshot

Galveston Island is a 27-mile barrier island in the Gulf of Mexico, connected to the Texas mainland by a causeway and ferry. The island's highest natural elevation is roughly 8 feet above sea level—though the seawall area, raised after the catastrophic 1900 hurricane, sits at about 17 feet. Galveston's history is inseparable from its climate exposure: the 1900 Great Storm killed an estimated 8,000 people and remains the deadliest natural disaster in U.S. history.

Modern Galveston (population ~53,000) faces escalating risks as sea levels rise, storms intensify, and the island's tourism-dependent economy absorbs repeated hurricane disruptions. Hurricane Ike (2008) caused $30 billion in regional damage, sent 12–15 feet of surge across the Bolivar Peninsula, and flooded 75% of Galveston's structures. Tide gauge data at Pier 21 shows roughly 24 inches of relative sea level rise since 1908—among the highest rates on the U.S. Gulf Coast, driven by a combination of global sea level rise and regional land subsidence.

The Galveston-Houston metro is the nation's largest petrochemical complex, and Galveston Bay's extensive port and industrial infrastructure adds economic urgency to the resilience challenge. UTMB Health, the University of Texas Medical Branch, is the island's largest employer and a critical medical facility that was severely damaged by Ike.

## Top Climate Risks

### Storm Surge & Hurricane Damage

Galveston's barrier island geography makes it acutely surge-vulnerable. The existing seawall protects only the Gulf-facing portion of the city. The bayside—including the historic Strand District and port facilities—is largely unprotected. NOAA SLOSH models show 15–22 feet of potential surge from a Category 4 storm. With sea level rise, future storms will achieve equivalent surge heights from weaker systems.

### Sea Level Rise & Land Subsidence

Relative sea level at Galveston has risen 24 inches since 1908, roughly double the global average rate. Subsidence from historical groundwater withdrawal accounts for much of the excess, though subsidence rates have slowed since the region shifted to surface water. NOAA's intermediate-high projection estimates an additional 2–3 feet by 2070. At those levels, much of the island's bayside would experience daily tidal flooding.

### Erosion & Habitat Loss

Galveston Island's Gulf-facing beaches erode at an average rate of 6–10 feet per year in unprotected areas. West of the seawall, erosion threatens residential development and public beach access. Galveston Bay has lost over 35,000 acres of coastal wetlands since the 1950s, reducing natural storm buffering capacity. The bay's oyster reefs—which once broke wave energy—have declined by 50% from overharvest, disease, and freshwater inflow changes.

## Local Climate Action

The City of Galveston's Comprehensive Plan (2023 update) incorporates sea level rise projections and climate resilience standards into land use, transportation, and infrastructure chapters. The plan discourages new development in areas below 6 feet elevation on the bayside and encourages density in higher-ground areas near the seawall.

The Gulf Coast Community Protection and Recovery District (GCCPRD), established by the Texas Legislature after Ike, is advancing the Coastal Texas Protection and Restoration Study—a $34 billion joint project with the Army Corps of Engineers. The "Ike Dike" component would construct a coastal spine including surge gates at Bolivar Roads, levees, and ring barriers to protect Galveston Bay.

UTMB Health invested $750 million in post-Ike campus resilience, including raising critical systems 15 feet above grade, installing 24 MW of backup generation, and building a storm-rated patient care facility designed to withstand Category 5 winds.

## Regulations & Incentives

Galveston enforces the Texas Windstorm Insurance Association (TWIA) construction standards, which require specific wind-resistant construction practices for properties to qualify for state windstorm insurance. The city's flood ordinance requires 2 feet of freeboard above BFE and prohibits fill in the floodway.

TX-PACE financing is available for commercial wind hardening, energy efficiency, and resilience improvements. The Texas General Land Office's Coastal Erosion Planning and Response Act (CEPRA) program provides grants for beach nourishment and shoreline stabilization, with typical awards of $1–5 million.

The Galveston Historical Foundation offers preservation tax credits and technical assistance for historic structures in the Strand and East End districts, including guidance on resilient rehabilitation that maintains historic character while improving storm resistance.

## Federal Funding Opportunities

The Army Corps' Coastal Texas Study is the single largest pending federal resilience investment for Galveston, with a recommended plan totaling $34 billion. The project received Congressional authorization in the Water Resources Development Act of 2024, with initial construction funding appropriated in FY2025.

FEMA HMGP funding post-Harvey ($28 billion disaster) has supported property elevation, acquisition, and infrastructure hardening across Galveston County. BRIC competitive grants supplement these funds.

NOAA's National Coastal Resilience Fund and the Gulf Environmental Benefit Fund (from the Deepwater Horizon settlement) have funded oyster reef restoration, living shoreline installation, and marsh creation in Galveston Bay, with cumulative investment exceeding $100 million.

The DOT's RAISE and INFRA grant programs have funded resilient transportation projects in the Galveston region, including causeway improvements and port infrastructure hardening.

## How Council Fire Can Help

Council Fire's Gulf Coast practice has deep experience with the complex institutional landscape of Galveston Bay resilience. We support municipalities, counties, and special districts with hazard mitigation planning, Army Corps coordination, and federal grant strategy spanning FEMA, NOAA, and DOT programs.

For historic preservation clients, we integrate resilience upgrades with preservation compliance—a specialty critical in Galveston's designated historic districts. Our sustainability consulting supports port operators, hospitality businesses, and healthcare systems with climate risk assessment, energy optimization, and ESG strategy tailored to the island's unique risk profile.

## Frequently Asked Questions

### What is the Ike Dike and when will it be built?

The "Ike Dike" is the informal name for the Coastal Texas Protection and Restoration Study's coastal spine component—a system of surge gates, levees, and ring barriers designed to protect Galveston Bay from Gulf storm surge. The project received WRDA 2024 authorization and initial FY2025 construction funding. Full construction is estimated at 15–20 years with a total cost of approximately $34 billion (65% federal, 35% non-federal). The Bolivar Roads surge gate—the system's centerpiece—would be one of the largest movable storm barriers in the world.

### How does land subsidence affect Galveston's flood risk?

Historical groundwater withdrawal caused significant land subsidence in the Galveston-Houston region, with some areas sinking 6–10 feet over the 20th century. While Galveston Island's subsidence rate has slowed since the shift to surface water, the cumulative effect has increased relative sea level rise at Galveston to roughly double the global rate. This means higher surge from equivalent storms and more frequent tidal flooding than global averages would suggest.

### Is it still safe to buy property on Galveston Island?

This is ultimately a risk-tolerance and financial question. Property on Galveston Island faces real and growing climate exposure, reflected in rising flood insurance premiums and windstorm insurance costs. Properties behind the seawall and above BFE with modern wind-rated construction face lower (but not zero) risk. The Ike Dike project, if completed, would significantly reduce surge risk but is 15+ years from full operation. Buyers should obtain elevation certificates, review TWIA requirements, and factor insurance costs into purchase decisions.
