## Climate Snapshot

Minneapolis, Minnesota, with a population of 430,000 in the city and 3.7 million in the metro area, sits at the confluence of the Mississippi River and the Minnesota River—a geography shaped by glaciers and defined by water. The "City of Lakes" contains 22 named lakes, extensive parkland, and a river system that both sustains and threatens the city. Minneapolis is one of the northernmost major cities in the United States, and its climate is among the most extreme—winter lows of -30°F and summer highs above 100°F in the same year.

But Minneapolis is warming faster than almost any major U.S. city. Winter temperatures have increased 5.3°F since 1970—more than twice the national average. While that might sound welcome, the consequences are severe: intensifying rainfall, earlier snowmelt floods, disrupted ecosystems, and a paradoxical increase in both extreme heat events and winter weather whiplash. The June 2024 derecho that struck the Twin Cities produced 80+ mph winds, knocked out power to 400,000 customers, and caused $800 million in damages—the costliest weather event in Minnesota history.

The region's demographics shape vulnerability. Minneapolis has one of the largest urban Native American populations and significant Somali, Hmong, and Latino communities, many concentrated in neighborhoods with aging housing stock, limited tree canopy, and disproportionate exposure to heat and flooding.

## Top Climate Risks

### Extreme Precipitation and Urban Flooding

Minneapolis has experienced a 37% increase in heavy precipitation events since 1958—the largest increase of any region in the country. The August 2019 storm dropped 7 inches of rain on the metro in 6 hours, overwhelming storm drains and flooding thousands of basements. The city's aging stormwater infrastructure was designed for mid-20th-century rainfall patterns and cannot handle today's intensified storms. Flash flooding is particularly severe in low-lying neighborhoods along Minnehaha Creek and the Mississippi River gorge.

### Extreme Heat

Minneapolis averages 14 days above 90°F, but projections show 30–50 such days by 2050. The July 2023 heat dome pushed temperatures above 100°F for four consecutive days. North Minneapolis and Phillips, neighborhoods with the least tree canopy and highest percentage of residents of color, experience surface temperatures 10–15°F above areas like Southwest Minneapolis. Heat-related ER visits in Hennepin County tripled between 2018 and 2023.

### Winter Weather Disruption and Temperature Volatility

Warming winters create a counterintuitive set of problems. Reduced snow cover weakens the insulating layer that protects infrastructure and ecosystems. Freeze-thaw cycles—increasing in frequency—crack roads, burst water mains, and destabilize foundations. The February 2019 polar vortex dropped Minneapolis to -56°F wind chill, straining the power grid and causing $2 billion in damages statewide. Climate models project continued Arctic warming that disrupts the jet stream, producing more frequent polar vortex incursions even as average temperatures rise.

## Local Climate Action

Minneapolis' Climate Action Plan (2013, updated 2022) targets 80% emissions reduction by 2050, with an interim goal of 30% by 2025. The plan was updated with a Climate Equity Plan that directs investment toward historically underserved communities, specifically North Minneapolis, Phillips, and Cedar-Riverside.

The city's Green Cost Share program provides grants for green infrastructure installations—rain gardens, native plantings, permeable pavement—on private property. Minneapolis has installed over 600 rain gardens through the program since 2015. The city's 2040 Comprehensive Plan eliminates single-family-only zoning citywide, supporting density that reduces transportation emissions and protects greenfield land.

Xcel Energy, the metro's primary utility, has committed to 100% carbon-free electricity by 2030, backed by Minnesota's Clean Energy Standard (2023) requiring 100% clean electricity by 2040. This makes the Minneapolis grid among the fastest-decarbonizing in the Midwest.

## Regulations & Incentives

Minnesota's 2023 Clean Energy Standard mandates 100% carbon-free electricity by 2040, with an 80% clean interim target by 2030. The state's weatherization assistance program is among the most well-funded in the country, providing up to $10,000 per household for insulation, air sealing, and HVAC upgrades. Minnesota's SolarSense program provides $5/watt rebates for income-qualified solar installations.

Minneapolis' Energy Disclosure Ordinance requires residential energy ratings at time of sale—one of the only cities in the nation with such a requirement. The city's green building policy requires LEED or B3 standards for city-funded projects. The stormwater utility fee funds drainage maintenance and incentivizes on-site management through credits.

Minnesota's C-PACE program enables commercial energy and resilience financing. Xcel Energy offers comprehensive rebates for heat pumps, insulation, smart thermostats, and EV charging.

## Federal Funding Opportunities

IRA incentives stack powerfully with Minnesota's state programs. HEEHRA rebates up to $14,000 combine with Xcel and state rebates for near-total cost coverage on residential electrification. The 30% solar ITC pairs with Minnesota's SolarSense rebate. EPA Greenhouse Gas Reduction Fund awards support clean energy financing in underserved communities.

FEMA BRIC awarded Minnesota $6.8 million in 2023 for flood mitigation and stormwater projects. The Army Corps' Mississippi River flood risk management studies address levee and infrastructure protection in the Twin Cities. EPA Clean Water State Revolving Fund loans support Minneapolis' stormwater infrastructure upgrades.

DOE's Weatherization Assistance Program provides significant formula funding to Minnesota. DOT PROTECT funding supports climate-resilient transportation. HUD CDBG funds support housing rehabilitation in flood- and heat-vulnerable neighborhoods.

## How Council Fire Can Help

Minneapolis faces a climate transition that's happening faster than in almost any other major city—warming at twice the national rate with infrastructure built for a different era. Council Fire helps municipal agencies, utilities, developers, and community organizations build resilience at the pace the climate demands.

For building owners, we provide energy disclosure compliance support, electrification planning, and incentive optimization across IRA, Xcel, and state programs. For stormwater management, Council Fire designs green infrastructure solutions that reduce flooding while providing community amenities.

Our climate equity practice aligns with Minneapolis' commitment to directing resilience investments toward frontline communities. Council Fire supports community-based organizations and city departments in building competitive BRIC, EPA, and HUD grant applications. We help Minneapolis adapt its northern infrastructure to a rapidly warming reality.

## Frequently Asked Questions

### What are the biggest climate risks facing Minneapolis?

Extreme precipitation and urban flooding are the most frequent threat, with heavy rainfall events increasing 37% since 1958. Extreme heat is a growing risk, particularly in neighborhoods with limited tree canopy. Winter weather disruption—polar vortex events, freeze-thaw infrastructure damage—remains a persistent hazard even as average temperatures rise.

### Does Minneapolis have a climate action plan?

Yes. Minneapolis targets 80% emissions reduction by 2050 with a strong climate equity component. Xcel Energy is committed to 100% carbon-free electricity by 2030. The city eliminated single-family-only zoning to support climate-smart growth. Over 600 rain gardens have been installed through the Green Cost Share program.

### What federal funding is available for climate resilience in Minnesota?

Minnesota received $6.8 million in FEMA BRIC funding in 2023. IRA incentives stack with state and utility programs for powerful savings. EPA Clean Water funds support stormwater upgrades. DOE Weatherization Assistance is well-funded. Army Corps studies address Mississippi River flood risk.
