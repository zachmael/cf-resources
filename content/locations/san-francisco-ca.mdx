## Climate Snapshot

San Francisco, population 808,000, occupies the tip of a 7-mile-wide peninsula between the Pacific Ocean and San Francisco Bay. The city packs dense urban development into just 47 square miles, with critical infrastructure—the Embarcadero, SFO Airport approach roads, the Bayview-Hunters Point neighborhood—sitting at or near sea level along the Bay shoreline.

While San Francisco avoids the hurricane risk of Gulf and East Coast cities, its climate threats are no less serious. Sea-level rise projections from the state's Ocean Protection Council estimate 1.1–2.7 feet of rise along San Francisco's Bay shoreline by 2060. The 2023 atmospheric river season demonstrated the region's flood vulnerability, with back-to-back storms in January causing $5 million in damages citywide, overwhelming stormwater systems, and flooding the Sunset District's aging infrastructure.

Wildfire smoke has emerged as a defining quality-of-life and public health issue. The 2020 fire season turned San Francisco's sky orange on September 9, producing images that circled the globe. The city experienced 30+ days of unhealthy air quality across the 2020 and 2021 fire seasons combined. Meanwhile, seismic risk—always present in the Bay Area—intersects with climate change as sea-level rise increases the area subject to earthquake-induced liquefaction.

## Top Climate Risks

### Sea-Level Rise and Coastal Flooding

San Francisco's Bay shoreline faces 1.1–2.7 feet of sea-level rise by 2060 under state projections. The Embarcadero seawall, a 3-mile structure built over 100 years ago on fill and timber piles, protects $100 billion in assets and infrastructure including BART and Muni tunnels. Voters approved a $425 million bond in 2018 to begin seawall improvements, but the full project is estimated at $5 billion. In Bayview-Hunters Point, Mission Bay, and Treasure Island, rising waters threaten recently developed neighborhoods built on fill.

### Wildfire Smoke and Air Quality

While San Francisco itself rarely burns, regional wildfires in the Sierra Nevada, North Bay, and Central Valley routinely blanket the city in hazardous smoke. PM2.5 levels during the 2020 fires exceeded 300 µg/m³—more than 20 times the WHO guideline. The health impacts are measurable: emergency room visits for respiratory complaints increased 35% during major smoke events. Climate projections show a 50% increase in wildfire area burned in California by 2050, suggesting more frequent and intense smoke seasons.

### Seismic-Climate Compound Risk

The Hayward Fault, rated the single most dangerous fault in the United States by the USGS, runs along the East Bay and is overdue for a magnitude 7+ event. Sea-level rise expands the liquefaction zone along the Bay shoreline, meaning that filled land in the Mission Bay, SOMA, and Embarcadero areas faces compounded seismic and flooding risk. A major earthquake during a high-water period could breach the Embarcadero seawall and flood transit tunnels.

## Local Climate Action

San Francisco's Climate Action Plan targets net-zero emissions by 2040—among the most ambitious timelines of any major U.S. city. The city has already reduced emissions 41% below 1990 levels as of 2022, driven largely by clean hydroelectric power from Hetch Hetchy and aggressive building electrification policies.

The city's All-Electric New Construction Ordinance (2021) prohibits natural gas in new buildings. The Existing Building Electrification Strategy targets gas-free existing buildings by 2035 for small commercial and 2040 for large buildings. San Francisco's updated Building Code Chapter 13C mandates solar-plus-storage on new construction over 10 stories.

The Sea Level Rise Action Plan (2023) establishes a citywide adaptation framework with near-term priorities including the Embarcadero Seawall Program, Islais Creek adaptation, and shoreline resilience in the southeast waterfront.

## Regulations & Incentives

California's regulatory framework is the nation's most aggressive on climate. AB 32, SB 32, and AB 1279 mandate statewide carbon neutrality by 2045. Title 24 building energy standards are updated triennially—the 2025 code requires electric-ready construction and solar-plus-storage on most new buildings. The state's cap-and-trade program generates billions for the Greenhouse Gas Reduction Fund, supporting clean energy and resilience projects.

San Francisco's local incentives include the GoSolarSF program (rebates up to $4,000 for residential solar), BayREN energy efficiency rebates for multifamily buildings, and the SF Environment Department's zero-waste and green business programs. Bay Area Air Quality Management District regulations on building emissions complement the city's electrification mandates.

California's Property Assessed Clean Energy (PACE) programs—both residential (now paused for consumer protection concerns) and commercial—enable financing for efficiency and resilience upgrades.

## Federal Funding Opportunities

The IRA is transformative for California. HEEHRA rebates of up to $14,000 per household stack with state and local incentives to dramatically reduce electrification costs. The 30% solar ITC and new standalone storage ITC accelerate deployment in the Bay Area's strong solar market. EPA's Greenhouse Gas Reduction Fund awarded California entities over $6 billion through the National Clean Investment Fund and Clean Communities Investment Accelerator.

FEMA BRIC awarded California $89 million in 2023—the largest state allocation. San Francisco's Embarcadero Seawall project has pursued FEMA and Army Corps funding streams. The DOT PROTECT program provides formula funding for California's climate-resilient transportation infrastructure.

NOAA's Climate-Ready Coasts program and the National Fish and Wildlife Foundation support nature-based solutions along San Francisco Bay, including wetland restoration and living shoreline projects.

## How Council Fire Can Help

San Francisco's regulatory complexity—intersecting state mandates, local ordinances, and federal funding programs—demands strategic navigation. Council Fire helps building owners, developers, and public agencies align compliance obligations with available incentives to minimize cost and maximize resilience.

For building owners facing electrification deadlines, Council Fire provides decarbonization roadmaps, retrofit design, and incentive stacking strategies that combine IRA credits, GoSolarSF rebates, and BayREN programs. For public agencies managing shoreline adaptation, we bring federal grant expertise and benefit-cost analysis capacity to BRIC, Army Corps, and EPA applications.

Council Fire's Bay Area practice understands the region's compound risks—seismic, flood, wildfire smoke—and designs resilience strategies that address multiple hazards simultaneously. We help San Francisco build the future its climate demands.

## Frequently Asked Questions

### What are the biggest climate risks facing San Francisco?

Sea-level rise threatens the Bay shoreline, including $100 billion in assets protected by the aging Embarcadero seawall. Wildfire smoke from regional fires creates recurring air quality crises. Seismic-climate compound risk—where sea-level rise expands liquefaction zones along filled land—is a unique Bay Area concern.

### Does San Francisco have a climate action plan?

Yes. San Francisco targets net-zero emissions by 2040 and has already cut emissions 41% below 1990 levels. The city bans natural gas in new construction, mandates building electrification on a phased timeline, and has adopted a comprehensive Sea Level Rise Action Plan. Voters approved a $425 million bond for the Embarcadero Seawall in 2018.

### What federal funding is available for climate resilience in California?

California received $89 million in FEMA BRIC funding in 2023—the nation's largest allocation. IRA incentives, including HEEHRA rebates and solar/storage tax credits, stack with robust state programs. EPA Greenhouse Gas Reduction Fund awards exceeded $6 billion to California entities. Army Corps, NOAA, and DOT programs provide additional resilience funding.
