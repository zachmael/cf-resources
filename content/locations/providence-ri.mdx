## Climate Snapshot

Providence, Rhode Island, population 190,000, sits at the head of Narragansett Bay—a geographic position that has defined the city's relationship with storms for centuries. The Providence River flows through downtown before emptying into the upper Bay, and the funnel shape of the waterway amplifies storm surge much like Tampa Bay does on the Gulf Coast.

The city's flood history is dramatic. The Great Hurricane of 1938 pushed a 17-foot storm surge into downtown Providence, flooding buildings to the second story and killing 262 people across New England. Hurricane Carol in 1954 produced a 15-foot surge. These catastrophes led to the construction of the Fox Point Hurricane Barrier in 1966—a 3,000-foot-long, 25-foot-high flood gate system that protects downtown from storm surge. The barrier has closed over 30 times since its construction, including for Superstorm Sandy in 2012.

Today, Providence faces a new challenge: the barrier was designed for 1960s sea levels. With 10 inches of sea-level rise already recorded at the Newport tide gauge since 1930, and projections of 1–3 feet more by 2060, the barrier's effective protection margin is shrinking. Meanwhile, inland flooding from intense rainfall events has become a chronic problem in neighborhoods that the barrier was never designed to protect.

## Top Climate Risks

### Storm Surge and Coastal Flooding

The Fox Point Hurricane Barrier provides critical protection but has finite capacity. The barrier's design elevation of 25 feet above mean low water provides a margin above the 100-year surge level, but sea-level rise is eroding that margin. A major hurricane producing surge that overtops or flanks the barrier would flood downtown Providence with devastating consequences—$10 billion in assets sit in the protected zone. Areas outside the barrier, including parts of East Providence and Warwick along the Bay shoreline, face unprotected surge risk.

### Inland Flooding and Stormwater

Providence's older neighborhoods—Federal Hill, Olneyville, South Providence—contend with chronic flooding from overwhelmed stormwater systems. The Woonasquatucket and Moshassuck Rivers, which converge to form the Providence River, rise rapidly during intense rainfall. The March 2010 flood event—16 inches of rain in two weeks—caused $100 million in damages across Rhode Island, with Providence particularly hard hit. Climate change is increasing the frequency of heavy precipitation events in the Northeast by 55% since 1958.

### Extreme Heat

Providence experiences 10–15 days above 90°F annually, projected to reach 30–50 days by 2050. The city's dense urban core, limited tree canopy in low-income neighborhoods, and aging housing stock without central AC create significant heat vulnerability. South Providence and Olneyville, with the highest poverty rates and least green space, face the greatest heat burden.

## Local Climate Action

Providence's Climate Justice Plan (2019) was the first municipal climate plan in the country to center environmental justice. It targets 100% renewable electricity by 2030 and an 80% reduction in community-wide emissions by 2050. The plan prioritizes investments in low-income communities and communities of color that bear disproportionate climate impacts.

The city established a Director of Sustainability and Climate position and has invested in green infrastructure, urban tree planting (10,000 trees committed by 2030), and building weatherization programs targeting low-income housing. The Providence Stormwater Innovation Center pilots green infrastructure designs for the city's combined sewer system, which overflows during heavy rain.

Rhode Island's Resilient Rhody initiative, coordinated by the state's Infrastructure Bank, funds municipal resilience projects. Providence has accessed these funds for stormwater improvements, urban heat mitigation, and community resilience hubs.

## Regulations & Incentives

Rhode Island's 2021 Act on Climate mandates net-zero emissions statewide by 2050, with interim targets of 45% reduction by 2030 and 80% by 2040. The state's Renewable Energy Standard requires 100% renewable electricity by 2033. Rhode Island's building energy code follows the 2021 IECC with state amendments favoring electrification.

Providence's zoning code includes a floodplain overlay district requiring 2 feet of freeboard. The city's Green Building Standards require LEED certifiable design for projects receiving public subsidy. Rhode Island's C-PACE program finances commercial energy efficiency and resilience upgrades.

National Grid (the local utility) offers robust rebates: up to $10,000 for heat pump installation, $4,000 for weatherization, and incentives for commercial lighting and HVAC. Rhode Island's Renewable Energy Fund provides grants for solar installations on affordable housing and community facilities.

## Federal Funding Opportunities

IRA incentives are significant for Rhode Island: HEEHRA rebates up to $14,000 stack with National Grid and state programs. The 30% solar ITC and standalone storage credit support distributed energy. EPA Greenhouse Gas Reduction Fund awards support clean energy financing in underserved communities.

FEMA BRIC awarded Rhode Island $4.2 million in 2023. The Army Corps of Engineers is evaluating upgrades to the Fox Point Hurricane Barrier, including raising the barrier height to account for sea-level rise—a project estimated at $150–300 million. NOAA coastal resilience grants support Narragansett Bay shoreline adaptation.

The DOT PROTECT program provides formula funding for climate-resilient transportation infrastructure. HUD CDBG funds support housing rehabilitation in flood-prone neighborhoods. EPA Clean Water State Revolving Fund loans fund Providence's combined sewer overflow elimination efforts.

## How Council Fire Can Help

Providence sits at the intersection of historic coastal risk and modern climate acceleration. Council Fire helps the city, state agencies, and private sector clients build resilience strategies that match the urgency.

For the Fox Point Hurricane Barrier upgrade process, Council Fire provides federal funding strategy and benefit-cost analysis to support Army Corps and FEMA applications. For building owners navigating Rhode Island's aggressive decarbonization timeline, we deliver electrification roadmaps and incentive stacking strategies.

Our green infrastructure and stormwater practice supports Providence's combined sewer overflow elimination program with design and implementation expertise. Council Fire brings the technical depth and funding acumen to help Providence protect downtown, adapt its neighborhoods, and lead on climate justice.

## Frequently Asked Questions

### What are the biggest climate risks facing Providence?

Storm surge at the head of Narragansett Bay is the catastrophic risk—the Fox Point Hurricane Barrier provides protection but faces diminishing margins from sea-level rise. Inland flooding from intense rainfall overwhelms aging stormwater systems in dense neighborhoods. Extreme heat is a growing threat, particularly in environmental justice communities with limited tree canopy.

### Does Providence have a climate action plan?

Yes. Providence's Climate Justice Plan (2019) was the first in the nation to center environmental justice. It targets 100% renewable electricity by 2030 and 80% emissions reduction by 2050. Rhode Island's Act on Climate mandates statewide net-zero by 2050. The city is investing in green infrastructure, urban forestry, and building weatherization.

### What federal funding is available for climate resilience in Rhode Island?

Rhode Island received $4.2 million in FEMA BRIC funding in 2023. The Army Corps is evaluating a $150–300 million upgrade to the Fox Point Hurricane Barrier. IRA rebates and tax credits stack with state and utility incentives. EPA, NOAA, HUD, and DOT programs provide additional resilience funding streams.
