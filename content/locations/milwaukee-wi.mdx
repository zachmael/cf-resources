## Climate Snapshot

Milwaukee, Wisconsin's largest city, has a population of approximately 577,000 and sits on the western shore of Lake Michigan at the confluence of three rivers—the Milwaukee, Menomonee, and Kinnickinnic. The city's geography funnels runoff from a 795-square-mile watershed through a dense urban core to the lakefront, creating severe flood risk during heavy precipitation events. Milwaukee's combined and separate sewer systems, managed by the Milwaukee Metropolitan Sewerage District (MMSD), handle both urban stormwater and wastewater.

In July 2010, over 7 inches of rain fell on Milwaukee in 3 hours, causing catastrophic flooding that damaged 36,000 homes and businesses. Damages exceeded $130 million, and MMSD's deep tunnel system—designed to capture CSO—overflowed for the first time in its history. In August 2023, a similar event dropped 5 inches of rain in 90 minutes on the south side, flooding 4,000 basements and causing $40 million in damages. Lake Michigan water levels, while currently receding from the 2020 record high, caused $25 million in shoreline erosion and infrastructure damage between 2019 and 2021.

Milwaukee is warming rapidly—average temperatures have increased 3.5°F since 1970, and winter minimum temperatures have risen nearly 5°F. The city recorded 24 days above 90°F in 2023, double the 1980-2000 average. Milwaukee's older housing stock—60% of units were built before 1960—leaves residents vulnerable to both cold and heat extremes.

## Top Climate Risks

### Urban Flooding
Milwaukee's three-river confluence and dense urban development create persistent flood risk. MMSD's Deep Tunnel system has 521 million gallons of storage capacity but has been overwhelmed during the most intense events. The district estimates that upgrading to handle future rainfall projections would cost an additional $1.5 billion. Over 5,500 properties in Milwaukee County are in the 100-year floodplain, with the Kinnickinnic River corridor—running through predominantly Latino neighborhoods on the south side—being the most flood-damaged waterway in Wisconsin. MMSD has spent $170 million on KK River flood mitigation since 2009, including concrete removal and channel widening.

### Extreme Heat
Milwaukee's population is poorly adapted to heat. A 2023 analysis by the Medical College of Wisconsin found that heat-related emergency visits increased 120% between 2015 and 2023. The city's near-north side—home to Milwaukee's largest Black community—experiences temperatures 9°F higher than lakefront neighborhoods, driven by low tree canopy (15% vs. 35%) and extensive impervious surfaces. Milwaukee has the lowest citywide tree canopy among major Great Lakes cities at 21%.

### Lake Michigan Volatility
Lake Michigan's increasingly volatile water levels—a 6-foot swing between the 2013 low and 2020 record high—damage shoreline infrastructure, erode bluffs, and threaten lakefront wastewater and water treatment facilities. Milwaukee's Jones Island Water Reclamation Facility sits at lake level and required $8 million in emergency flood protection during the 2020 high-water period. Warming lake temperatures reduce ice cover (down 50% since 1990), intensifying wave energy and lake-effect precipitation.

## Local Climate Action

Milwaukee adopted its first Climate and Equity Plan in 2023, setting a target of carbon neutrality by 2050 with an interim 45% reduction by 2030 from a 2018 baseline. The plan explicitly ties climate action to racial equity, recognizing that Milwaukee—one of America's most segregated cities—faces starkly unequal climate exposure.

MMSD's Green Infrastructure Program, launched in 2010, has invested $100 million in nature-based stormwater solutions, including the conversion of concrete channels to naturalized waterways, rain garden installations, and green roof incentives. The district's goal is to capture the first 0.5 inches of rainfall across 10% of the combined sewer service area through green infrastructure by 2035.

The city's ReFresh Milwaukee plan guides sustainability operations, including solar installations on 17 city buildings (2.8 MW total), the electrification of 120 city fleet vehicles, and the Energy Efficiency and Water Conservation Grant for small businesses providing up to $10,000 per project.

## Regulations & Incentives

Wisconsin's statewide climate policy is limited, but the Governor's Clean Energy Plan (2022) set a non-binding target of 100% carbon-free electricity by 2050. We Energies, Milwaukee's primary utility, offers net metering, a solar buy-back rate, and the Badger Power solar community program. Focus on Energy, Wisconsin's statewide utility program, provides residential rebates for insulation, air sealing, and heat pumps.

MMSD's green infrastructure grants program provides up to $5,000 for residential rain gardens and up to $100,000 for commercial green roof installations. The district's Stormwater Management Fee credit offers 15-30% reduction for properties with qualifying BMPs. Milwaukee's Eco-Renovation Permit (2023) expedites and reduces fees for projects meeting high-efficiency standards.

Wisconsin's Property Assessed Clean Energy (PACE) program enables commercial buildings to finance clean energy and resilience upgrades. The Milwaukee Energy Efficiency (Me2) program provides free energy assessments and financing for residential improvements.

## Federal Funding Opportunities

Wisconsin's IRA Home Energy Rebate allocation totals $130 million. Milwaukee residents can access up to $8,000 for heat pump installations and $14,000 for income-qualified households. Federal 30% tax credits for solar, batteries, and efficiency improvements are available through 2032.

FEMA BRIC awarded $16 million to Milwaukee County in 2023 for Kinnickinnic River flood mitigation. The EPA's Great Lakes Restoration Initiative ($350 million annually) has funded $15 million in Milwaukee-area projects since 2020, including habitat restoration along the Milwaukee River estuary and stormwater management in the Menomonee Valley.

The Bipartisan Infrastructure Law's water infrastructure funding is supporting MMSD's deep tunnel and green infrastructure expansion, with Wisconsin receiving $740 million in State Revolving Fund allocations. DOE Weatherization allocated $30 million to Wisconsin in 2023. EPA Climate Pollution Reduction Grants provided the Milwaukee region with $3 million in planning funds.

## How Council Fire Can Help

Council Fire's integrated water management, urban resilience, and environmental justice expertise positions us to support Milwaukee's interconnected climate challenges. Our green infrastructure practice can optimize MMSD's program—designing watershed-scale strategies that maximize stormwater capture while delivering co-benefits for Milwaukee's most segregated and underserved neighborhoods.

For Milwaukee's Climate and Equity Plan implementation, Council Fire provides building decarbonization strategies for the city's aging housing stock, heat mitigation planning, and federal grant navigation. Our experience with Great Lakes communities informs our approach to shoreline resilience and water level adaptation.

Council Fire's equity focus is critical in Milwaukee, where climate exposure maps directly onto racial and economic segregation. We design resilience investments that deliberately address these disparities—putting trees, green infrastructure, and energy efficiency improvements where they're needed most.

## Frequently Asked Questions

### What are the biggest climate risks facing Milwaukee?
Milwaukee faces urban flooding (36,000 properties damaged in the 2010 event, 5,500 in the 100-year floodplain), extreme heat (heat-related ER visits up 120% since 2015, with 9°F temperature disparities between Black and lakefront neighborhoods), and Lake Michigan volatility (6-foot water level swings damaging shoreline infrastructure). Milwaukee's aging housing stock and deep racial segregation amplify vulnerability.

### Does Milwaukee have a climate action plan?
Yes. Milwaukee adopted its Climate and Equity Plan in 2023, targeting carbon neutrality by 2050 and 45% emissions reduction by 2030. The plan centers racial equity explicitly. Key programs include MMSD's $100 million green infrastructure investment, 2.8 MW of solar on city buildings, fleet electrification, and the $170 million Kinnickinnic River flood mitigation project.

### What federal funding is available for climate resilience in Wisconsin?
Wisconsin communities can access $130 million in IRA Home Energy Rebates, FEMA BRIC grants ($16 million to Milwaukee County in 2023), EPA Great Lakes Restoration Initiative funds ($350 million annually), Bipartisan Infrastructure Law water funding ($740 million for Wisconsin), and DOE Weatherization ($30 million for Wisconsin in 2023). Federal 30% tax credits for solar and battery storage run through 2032.

### How does segregation affect Milwaukee's climate resilience?
Milwaukee is one of America's most segregated cities, and climate risk maps directly onto racial geography. The near-north side—Milwaukee's largest Black community—experiences temperatures 9°F higher than lakefront areas and has only 15% tree canopy (vs. 35% lakefront). The south side's Latino neighborhoods along the Kinnickinnic River face the highest flood risk. The city's 2023 Climate and Equity Plan explicitly targets these disparities.
