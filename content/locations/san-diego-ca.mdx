## Climate Snapshot

San Diego, with 1.4 million residents in the city and 3.3 million in the county, stretches 70 miles of Pacific coastline and reaches 60 miles inland to mountain and desert terrain. The region's Mediterranean climate—warm, dry summers and mild, wet winters—is shifting. Rainfall is becoming more episodic, temperatures are climbing, and the wildland-urban interface extends across much of the inland county.

Wildfire has struck repeatedly. The October 2003 Cedar Fire burned 280,000 acres, destroyed 2,820 structures, and killed 15 people—at the time, the largest fire in California history. The October 2007 Witch Creek and Harris fires forced the evacuation of 500,000 residents and destroyed 1,600 homes. More recently, the 2024 fire season brought multiple ignitions to inland San Diego County during Santa Ana wind events.

Water scarcity is a structural challenge. San Diego imports 80–90% of its water, primarily from the Colorado River and the State Water Project via the Metropolitan Water District. A $1 billion desalination plant in Carlsbad (operational since 2015) provides about 10% of county supply, but the region remains fundamentally dependent on imported water in a basin facing long-term decline.

## Top Climate Risks

### Wildfire

San Diego County contains 1.3 million acres of fire-prone wildland, with over 250,000 homes in the Very High Fire Hazard Severity Zone. Santa Ana winds—hot, dry offshore gusts exceeding 60 mph—create extreme fire conditions multiple times each year. The 2003 and 2007 fire complexes together caused over $5 billion in damages. Climate projections suggest a 25–50% increase in critical fire weather days by 2050 as temperatures rise and vegetation dries earlier.

### Sea-Level Rise and Coastal Erosion

San Diego's 70 miles of coastline include $22 billion in property within the coastal zone. The state's 2018 sea-level rise projections estimate 1–2.5 feet of rise by 2060 along San Diego's coast. Coastal bluffs in Del Mar, Encinitas, and Solana Beach are already eroding at rates of 1–3 feet per year—a process that accelerates with rising seas and intensifying storm waves. The San Diego International Airport, with runway elevations of just 15–17 feet, faces long-term flood risk from combined sea-level rise and storm surge.

### Water Supply Vulnerability

The Colorado River, which supplies roughly half of San Diego's imported water, has experienced a 20% decline in flow since 2000. Lake Mead and Lake Powell have dropped to record-low levels. While San Diego's investments in desalination, water recycling (the Pure Water program), and conservation have improved local supply security, prolonged megadrought could strain even diversified portfolios. Climate models project an additional 10–20% decline in Colorado River flow by 2050.

## Local Climate Action

San Diego's Climate Action Plan (CAP), adopted in 2015 and updated in 2022, targets net-zero emissions by 2035—among the most aggressive timelines in the nation. Key strategies include 100% renewable electricity by 2035, elimination of 50% of vehicle miles traveled through land-use changes and transit investment, and zero-waste by 2040.

The city's Climate Resilient SD plan addresses adaptation, focusing on wildfire preparedness, coastal resilience, and water security. San Diego's Pure Water program, a $5 billion investment, will produce 83 million gallons per day of purified recycled water by 2035—enough to supply nearly half the city's needs and dramatically reduce imported water dependence.

San Diego Community Power, the region's community choice energy provider launched in 2021, serves 1 million customers with 50–100% renewable electricity at rates competitive with SDG&E.

## Regulations & Incentives

California's statewide regulations (AB 1279 carbon neutrality by 2045, Title 24 building codes, cap-and-trade) apply fully in San Diego. The city's CAP Consistency Regulations require new development to demonstrate compliance with climate plan goals, including transit-oriented design and building efficiency standards.

San Diego's updated Building Energy Benchmarking Ordinance requires commercial buildings over 20,000 square feet to disclose energy use annually. The city's Wildland-Urban Interface building standards mandate ignition-resistant construction materials and defensible space for properties in fire hazard zones.

SDG&E offers rebates for heat pumps, energy storage, and EV charging. San Diego Community Power's Power Share program provides discounted renewable energy for income-qualified households. California's Self-Generation Incentive Program (SGIP) provides rebates up to $1,000/kWh for battery storage, with enhanced incentives for fire-threat and medical-baseline customers.

## Federal Funding Opportunities

IRA incentives are substantial in San Diego's solar-rich market: 30% solar and storage ITC, HEEHRA rebates up to $14,000, and clean vehicle credits. FEMA BRIC funds wildfire mitigation and coastal resilience projects—California received $89 million in 2023. The USDA's Community Wildfire Defense Grant program supports defensible space and vegetation management in San Diego County's fire-prone communities.

The Army Corps' San Diego Shoreline Protection Study evaluates beach nourishment and coastal structure improvements. NOAA's National Coastal Resilience Fund supports nature-based shoreline adaptation. The Bureau of Reclamation's WaterSMART program funds water recycling and efficiency projects, directly relevant to San Diego's Pure Water program.

DOT PROTECT formula funding supports climate-resilient transportation infrastructure. The DOE Loan Programs Office and Title 17 clean energy loan guarantee program support large-scale renewable energy and storage projects in the San Diego market.

## How Council Fire Can Help

San Diego's triple challenge—wildfire, water, and coastline—demands integrated resilience strategies. Council Fire helps property owners, utilities, and public agencies connect climate risk analysis with funded solutions.

For property owners in wildfire zones, we provide fire-adapted design, defensible space planning, and FEMA/USDA grant applications. For coastal property owners and municipalities, Council Fire delivers sea-level rise vulnerability assessments and coastal adaptation design that aligns with California Coastal Commission requirements.

Our water resilience practice supports rainwater harvesting, greywater reuse, and drought-adapted landscape design. For commercial building owners, Council Fire navigates the intersection of CAP compliance, benchmarking requirements, and available incentives to build cost-effective decarbonization strategies. We help San Diego protect its coastline, secure its water future, and adapt to fire.

## Frequently Asked Questions

### What are the biggest climate risks facing San Diego?

Wildfire threatens hundreds of thousands of homes across the county's extensive wildland-urban interface, with Santa Ana winds creating extreme fire conditions. Sea-level rise and coastal erosion jeopardize $22 billion in coastal property. Water supply vulnerability—driven by declining Colorado River flows and drought—remains a structural challenge despite significant local investment.

### Does San Diego have a climate action plan?

Yes. San Diego's Climate Action Plan targets net-zero emissions by 2035. The city's Pure Water program ($5 billion) will provide nearly half the city's water supply through recycling by 2035. San Diego Community Power delivers renewable electricity to 1 million customers. Climate Resilient SD addresses wildfire, coastal, and water adaptation.

### What federal funding is available for climate resilience in California?

California receives the largest FEMA BRIC allocation nationally ($89 million in 2023). IRA solar, storage, and electrification incentives are substantial. USDA wildfire defense grants, Army Corps shoreline protection studies, Bureau of Reclamation WaterSMART funding, and NOAA coastal resilience grants all support San Diego-area projects.
