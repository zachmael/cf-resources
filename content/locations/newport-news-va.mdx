## Climate Snapshot

Newport News occupies a long, narrow peninsula between the James River and the Hampton Roads harbor, stretching 25 miles from the shipyard-dominated southeastern tip to the suburban north. The city's identity is built on defense: Huntington Ingalls Industries' Newport News Shipbuilding—the nation's sole builder of nuclear aircraft carriers—is the largest industrial employer in Virginia, with 25,000 workers and a waterfront campus spanning over 550 acres.

Hampton Roads' accelerated sea level rise (18 inches over the past century at Sewells Point) and land subsidence affect Newport News directly. The city's southeastern quarter, including the shipyard, downtown, and historic East End neighborhoods, sits at elevations below 10 feet. Tidal flooding in these areas has increased from occasional inconvenience to chronic disruption, with flood events at the James River shoreline occurring 15+ times per year.

Newport News is also home to NASA Langley Research Center, Joint Base Langley-Eustis (Fort Eustis component), and a concentration of defense contractors—all of which face varying degrees of flood and storm exposure. The city's population (186,000) includes significant environmental justice communities in the Southeast quadrant that bear disproportionate flood risk.

## Top Climate Risks

### Sea Level Rise & Shipyard Vulnerability

Newport News Shipbuilding's dry docks, construction halls, and supply chain infrastructure line the James River waterfront at low elevation. Even modest storm surge—3–5 feet—can disrupt operations at the yard, with national security implications for aircraft carrier and submarine construction schedules. DOD has identified the shipyard as a critical defense industrial base facility requiring climate adaptation investment. The city's downtown and East End neighborhoods face similar low-elevation exposure.

### Riverine & Tidal Flooding

The Deep Creek, Lucas Creek, and Newmarket Creek watersheds drain directly into the James River through increasingly tide-locked outfalls. Major rainfall events produce severe flooding in the Denbigh, Hidenwood, and Oyster Point areas. The October 2016 nor'easter—compounded by Hurricane Matthew's rainfall—flooded over 1,500 structures citywide. As sea levels rise, these watersheds lose drainage capacity, increasing both the frequency and depth of flooding.

### Extreme Heat & Aging Infrastructure

Newport News averages 50 days per year above 90°F, projected to reach 70–90 days by 2050. The city's aging building stock—much of it built before 1970 with limited insulation—is poorly adapted to extreme heat, increasing energy costs and health risks for low-income residents. Water and sewer infrastructure, some dating to the 1920s, faces accelerated deterioration from temperature cycling, groundwater intrusion, and corrosion.

## Local Climate Action

The City of Newport News adopted its Resilient Hampton Roads Framework Implementation Plan in 2023, aligning local priorities with the regional adaptation strategy. The plan identifies $200 million in flood mitigation needs, prioritizing the Southeast Community (East End, Newmarket Creek) and the Oyster Point commercial district.

The city's stormwater utility, established in 2018, generates approximately $12 million annually for drainage improvements, green infrastructure, and flood mitigation. A $30 million Lucas Creek watershed project—including detention basins, channel improvements, and tide gates—broke ground in 2024.

The Hampton Roads Bioregional Resilience and Adaptation Network brings together military installations, municipalities, and academic institutions (including NASA Langley's climate research capacity) to coordinate adaptation science and practice across the region.

## Regulations & Incentives

Newport News enforces a 2-foot freeboard requirement above BFE and requires sea level rise analysis for major development applications in the floodplain. The city participates in the CRS program at a Class 7 rating, providing 15% flood insurance premium reductions.

Virginia's Clean Economy Act provisions apply, with Dominion Energy's renewable energy and energy efficiency programs available to residents and businesses. The Virginia PACE Authority enables commercial PACE financing in the city.

The Hampton Roads Military and Federal Facilities Alliance coordinates defense-community resilience investments, facilitating alignment between DOD installation adaptation plans and municipal infrastructure projects.

## Federal Funding Opportunities

DOD's Defense Community Infrastructure Program (DCIP) and the Military Installation Resilience Program are key funding sources for Newport News, given the concentration of defense assets. REPI program investments protect buffer lands and reduce encroachment on installations.

FEMA BRIC and HMGP programs have funded over $15 million in Newport News flood mitigation projects since 2016, including property acquisition in the East End and stormwater infrastructure in the Denbigh area.

HUD's CDBG program provides annual formula funding that Newport News directs toward housing rehabilitation and infrastructure improvements in low-income flood-prone neighborhoods. EPA's Environmental Justice Collaborative Problem-Solving grants support community-led resilience planning in the Southeast community.

The Army Corps' James River Flood Risk Management Study is evaluating shoreline protection and flood mitigation alternatives for the Newport News waterfront, with potential federal investment of $100–300 million.

## How Council Fire Can Help

Council Fire brings specialized expertise in defense-community resilience to Newport News's unique challenge set. We support municipal clients with hazard mitigation planning, Army Corps coordination, and federal grant strategy across FEMA, DOD, and HUD programs.

For defense industrial base clients, we provide climate vulnerability assessments that quantify operational risk from flooding, heat, and supply chain disruption. Our environmental justice practice supports community-engaged resilience planning in Newport News's most vulnerable neighborhoods, ensuring that adaptation investments reach the people who need them most.

## Frequently Asked Questions

### How does climate change affect Newport News Shipbuilding?

The shipyard's low-elevation waterfront campus faces increasing flood risk from sea level rise and storm surge. Even temporary flooding can halt production, with ripple effects on aircraft carrier and submarine delivery schedules that have national security significance. DOD and Huntington Ingalls have invested in waterfront hardening, but the long-term challenge requires coordinated infrastructure investment between the shipyard, the city, and federal agencies. The Army Corps' James River study is evaluating shoreline protection options.

### What is being done about flooding in the East End?

The East End (Southeast Community) is the focus of a multi-agency resilience initiative. The city has completed property acquisitions in the most flood-damaged blocks, invested in stormwater upgrades, and secured HUD CDBG funding for housing rehabilitation. A comprehensive Newmarket Creek watershed study (2024) recommends $50 million in additional improvements including detention, channel restoration, and living shorelines. Environmental justice grants support community organizing and planning capacity.

### Are there flood mitigation grants available for Newport News homeowners?

Yes. FEMA's HMGP and FMA programs fund property elevation, acquisition, and flood-proofing for eligible homeowners. Virginia's Resilient Virginia Revolving Loan Fund provides low-interest financing for residential resilience improvements. The city's stormwater utility provides technical assistance and maintains information on active grant programs. Low- and moderate-income homeowners may qualify for additional assistance through HUD CDBG-funded programs.
