## Climate Snapshot

Charleston, South Carolina, with a population of approximately 155,000 in the city and 820,000 in the metro area, occupies a low-lying peninsula where the Ashley and Cooper Rivers meet Charleston Harbor. The city's average elevation is just 10 feet above sea level, and much of the historic downtown sits below 12 feet—well within reach of storm surge and king tides.

Charleston has flooded with alarming frequency. The city recorded 89 tidal flood events in 2019, up from an annual average of 4 in the 1970s. Hurricane Hugo in 1989 remains the benchmark disaster—a Category 4 storm that generated a 20-foot surge and caused $7 billion in damages (inflation-adjusted) across the Lowcountry. More recently, the "1,000-year" rainfall event of October 2015 dropped 20 inches in 72 hours, flooding 60,000 structures regionwide. Hurricane Ian in 2022, though centered on Florida, pushed a 5-foot surge into downtown Charleston, flooding the Market area and displacing hundreds.

The economic stakes are enormous. Charleston's tourism industry generates $8 billion annually, the Port of Charleston is the eighth-busiest container port in the U.S., and the metro area has attracted $10 billion in advanced manufacturing investment since 2018—all assets exposed to escalating coastal hazards.

## Top Climate Risks

### Sea-Level Rise and Tidal Flooding

Sea levels at the Charleston tide gauge have risen 13 inches since 1930 and are projected to rise an additional 1–2.5 feet by 2050 under intermediate scenarios. The city's stormwater system was designed in the 1980s for conditions that no longer exist. NOAA projects 130–200 tidal flood days per year by 2050 under high scenarios, which would render portions of the peninsula functionally inaccessible during significant parts of the year.

### Hurricanes and Storm Surge

Charleston's funnel-shaped harbor amplifies storm surge. A Category 3 hurricane on the current coastline could push 12–18 feet of surge into the peninsula. With $14 billion in property value in the FEMA-designated floodplain, the city's financial exposure to a single major hurricane ranks among the highest in the Southeast. The 2024 hurricane season brought two near-misses that drove renewed urgency around surge preparedness.

### Extreme Precipitation and Compound Flooding

The Southeast has experienced a 27% increase in heavy precipitation events since 1958. Charleston's flat topography and high water table mean that rainfall has nowhere to go. When heavy rain coincides with high tides—compound flooding—the damage multiplies. The October 2015 event demonstrated this: rivers, storm drains, and tides all peaked simultaneously, overwhelming every drainage pathway.

## Local Climate Action

Charleston released its Flooding and Sea Level Rise Strategy in 2019, backed by a $2 billion commitment over 50 years. The first phase focuses on the peninsula's drainage system, including the $200 million Spring-Fishburne Drainage Improvement Project—a deep tunnel system designed to handle 10-year rainfall events during high tides.

The city hired its first Chief Resilience Officer in 2017 and established the Dutch Dialogues Charleston partnership, bringing Netherlands-based water management expertise to local planning. The 2021 update to the city's comprehensive plan integrates sea-level rise projections into all land-use decisions and establishes an "accommodation zone" framework for areas where structural protection may not be feasible long-term.

Charleston County's Green Infrastructure Plan promotes natural drainage solutions, including wetland restoration, living shorelines, and rain gardens across the urbanized Lowcountry.

## Regulations & Incentives

South Carolina's regulatory environment is less aggressive than northeastern states, but Charleston has moved independently. The city's updated flood damage prevention ordinance requires 3 feet of freeboard above base flood elevation for new construction—among the highest local standards in the Southeast. A 2019 ordinance mandates stormwater detention for any project adding more than 500 square feet of impervious surface.

South Carolina's energy incentives include net metering for systems up to 1 MW and a 25% state tax credit for solar installations (capped at $3,500 for residential). The state's Disaster Relief and Resilience Act (2020) created a dedicated resilience fund and established the SC Office of Resilience, which administers FEMA Hazard Mitigation Grant Program (HMGP) funds and coordinates state-level adaptation efforts.

Charleston's historic preservation district overlay adds complexity to resilience retrofits, requiring Board of Architectural Review approval for exterior modifications including flood elevation and barrier installations.

## Federal Funding Opportunities

The Army Corps of Engineers' Charleston Peninsula Coastal Flood Risk Management Study was authorized in the 2022 WRDA at an estimated $1.4 billion. The proposed project includes a perimeter storm surge wall, barrier gates, and interior drainage improvements to protect 3,500 acres of the peninsula. Construction could begin as early as 2027.

FEMA's BRIC program awarded South Carolina $15.8 million in 2023, with Charleston County projects among the recipients. The FMA program targets the state's 2,100+ repetitive-loss properties, many concentrated in the Lowcountry.

IRA incentives provide significant opportunities: HEEHRA rebates up to $14,000 per household, 30% federal solar ITC, and Greenhouse Gas Reduction Fund financing for clean energy projects. The DOT PROTECT program channels formula funding to South Carolina for climate-resilient transportation infrastructure.

## How Council Fire Can Help

Charleston's resilience challenge requires navigating a complex web of federal funding programs, historic preservation requirements, and evolving local regulations. Council Fire brings deep expertise in coastal resilience planning, federal grant strategy, and the intersection of adaptation with economic development.

We support the city and county agencies pursuing Army Corps and FEMA funding with benefit-cost analyses, environmental compliance support, and project management. For developers and property owners in the historic district, Council Fire provides flood mitigation design that satisfies both resilience standards and architectural review requirements.

Our Lowcountry work also extends to nature-based solutions—living shorelines, wetland restoration, and green infrastructure—that deliver both flood risk reduction and environmental co-benefits. Council Fire helps Charleston protect what makes it irreplaceable while preparing for the climate reality ahead.

## Frequently Asked Questions

### What are the biggest climate risks facing Charleston?

Sea-level rise and tidal flooding are Charleston's most pressing threats, with tidal flood events increasing from 4 per year in the 1970s to nearly 90 in recent years. Hurricanes and storm surge pose catastrophic risk given the city's low elevation and funnel-shaped harbor. Extreme rainfall and compound flooding round out the top three.

### Does Charleston have a climate action plan?

Charleston's Flooding and Sea Level Rise Strategy (2019) commits $2 billion over 50 years to drainage improvements, coastal barriers, and managed adaptation. The city has a Chief Resilience Officer, participates in the Dutch Dialogues partnership, and integrates sea-level rise into land-use planning. A $1.4 billion Army Corps coastal flood risk management project has been authorized for the peninsula.

### What federal funding is available for climate resilience in South Carolina?

South Carolina benefits from the $1.4 billion Army Corps Charleston Peninsula study, FEMA BRIC and FMA grants ($15.8 million in 2023), IRA electrification rebates and solar tax credits, DOT PROTECT formula funding, and HUD CDBG-DR allocations following declared disasters. The SC Office of Resilience coordinates state-level distribution of HMGP and other federal resilience dollars.
