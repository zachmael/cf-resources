## Climate Snapshot

Virginia stretches from the Atlantic coast to the Appalachian highlands, encompassing an extraordinary range of climate vulnerabilities across its 42,775 square miles. The Hampton Roads region on the coast faces some of the fastest sea level rise in North America. The Piedmont and Northern Virginia deal with extreme heat and intensifying precipitation. The Shenandoah Valley and southwestern Virginia confront flash flooding, drought, and shifting agricultural conditions.

The state has warmed approximately 2°F since the 1960s, with nights warming faster than days across all regions. Sea level at the Sewells Point tide gauge (Norfolk) has risen 18 inches over the past century—roughly twice the global average, driven by land subsidence from glacial isostatic adjustment. Virginia's coastline is subsiding at 1–3 mm per year, compounding global sea level rise.

Virginia's 8.6 million residents and diversified economy—including the nation's largest concentration of military installations, a robust technology sector in Northern Virginia, agriculture across the Piedmont and Valley, and tourism statewide—face climate risks that vary dramatically by region but collectively demand coordinated state action.

## Top Climate Risks

### Coastal Sea Level Rise & Flooding

Hampton Roads is the second-largest population center at risk from sea level rise in the United States (after Miami). The region's 1.8 million residents face accelerating tidal flooding, with Sewells Point recording 20+ flood events per year—quadruple the frequency of the 1990s. VIMS projects 1.5 to 3 feet of additional rise by 2060. Norfolk, Virginia Beach, Hampton, and Newport News have invested billions in adaptation, but the scale of the challenge far exceeds current spending.

### Extreme Precipitation & Inland Flooding

Virginia has experienced a 40% increase in heavy precipitation events since the 1950s. The remnants of Hurricane Ida (2021) killed four people and caused $100 million in damage in Northern Virginia. Southwestern Virginia's Buchanan County experienced catastrophic flash flooding in 2022 that destroyed entire communities. Aging stormwater infrastructure across the state's cities—particularly Richmond, Alexandria, and Roanoke—cannot keep pace with intensifying rainfall.

### Extreme Heat

Richmond averages 45 days per year above 90°F, projected to reach 70–90 days by 2050. Northern Virginia's urban heat island amplifies temperatures by 5–8°F in the densest parts of Arlington and Fairfax County. Heat-related illness costs Virginia's healthcare system an estimated $50 million annually. Agricultural heat stress is reducing crop yields in the Piedmont, particularly for heat-sensitive livestock and specialty crops.

## Local Climate Action

Virginia's Clean Economy Act (2020) mandates that Dominion Energy achieve 100% carbon-free electricity by 2045 and Appalachian Power by 2050, with interim targets driving rapid utility-scale solar and offshore wind deployment. The Coastal Virginia Offshore Wind project (2.6 GW) is the centerpiece of the state's clean energy transition.

Executive Order 71 (2023) established the Virginia Flood Resilience Master Plan and created the Chief Resilience Officer position. The state's first comprehensive flood resilience strategy identifies $3 billion in priority investments across coastal, riverine, and urban flood risk reduction.

The Virginia Community Flood Preparedness Fund, capitalized through Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative (RGGI) auction proceeds, provides grants and loans for local flood mitigation projects. The fund has distributed over $100 million since its creation in 2020, with a priority set-aside for disadvantaged communities.

## Regulations & Incentives

Virginia's Flood Risk Management Standard requires state-funded projects to account for sea level rise (1.5 feet for coastal projects, 20% precipitation increase for inland) in design. The state's building code incorporates the 2021 IBC with amendments for wind and flood provisions.

The Virginia Clean Economy Act's Renewable Portfolio Standard drives utility investment in solar, wind, and storage. Net metering, solar property tax exemptions, and the state's Green Job Creation Tax Credit support private renewable energy adoption. Virginia's PACE-enabling legislation allows localities to establish commercial PACE programs.

The Chesapeake Bay Preservation Act requires all Bay watershed localities to adopt Resource Protection Areas with 100-foot buffers and water quality impact assessments for new development. These provisions serve dual purposes for water quality and flood resilience.

## Federal Funding Opportunities

The Army Corps' Norfolk District manages over $2 billion in active or planned coastal and flood risk management projects across Virginia, including the Norfolk Coastal Storm Risk Management Study, the Virginia Beach feasibility study, and multiple Hampton Roads shoreline protection projects.

FEMA's Community Flood Preparedness Fund supplements state funding, and BRIC competitive grants have awarded over $40 million to Virginia projects since 2020. The state's HMGP allocations from multiple presidential disaster declarations fund ongoing property elevation and acquisition programs.

The Chesapeake Bay Program provides over $90 million annually in EPA funding for watershed restoration, with Virginia receiving significant allocations for agricultural BMPs, stormwater retrofits, and wetland conservation.

The Bipartisan Infrastructure Law and IRA collectively provide billions in climate-relevant funding through DOE (building efficiency, EV infrastructure), EPA (CWSRF, CPRG), DOT (resilient transportation), and NOAA (coastal resilience) programs for which Virginia projects are competitive.

## How Council Fire Can Help

Council Fire's Virginia practice spans the state's full climate risk spectrum. In Hampton Roads, we support sea level rise planning, Army Corps feasibility study coordination, and military-community resilience partnerships. In Northern Virginia and Richmond, we focus on stormwater infrastructure, building performance, and urban heat mitigation.

Our federal funding expertise helps Virginia localities access the Community Flood Preparedness Fund, FEMA BRIC, Army Corps programs, and IRA-funded initiatives. For commercial real estate clients, we provide climate risk disclosure support, building decarbonization planning, and green building certification aligned with Virginia's evolving clean energy requirements.

## Frequently Asked Questions

### Why is Virginia sinking?

Virginia's coastal land is subsiding at 1–3 mm per year due primarily to glacial isostatic adjustment—a geological process where land that was uplifted when ice sheets depressed areas to the north during the last Ice Age is now slowly settling back down. Historical groundwater withdrawal in the Hampton Roads region has added to subsidence. This land subsidence roughly doubles the rate of relative sea level rise experienced along Virginia's coast compared to the global average.

### What is the Virginia Community Flood Preparedness Fund?

Created in 2020 and funded through RGGI auction proceeds, the Fund provides grants and low-interest loans to Virginia localities for flood mitigation projects. At least 25% of funds must benefit disadvantaged communities. Projects funded include property acquisition, stormwater infrastructure, living shorelines, and flood warning systems. The Fund has distributed over $100 million and represents Virginia's primary state-funded flood resilience mechanism.

### How will offshore wind affect Virginia?

The 2.6 GW Coastal Virginia Offshore Wind project (176 turbines, 27 miles off Virginia Beach) will be the nation's largest offshore wind farm when operational in 2027. The project is creating thousands of construction and operations jobs, driving port infrastructure investment at the Portsmouth Marine Terminal, and establishing Hampton Roads as the East Coast's offshore wind hub. Dominion's lease area could support up to 6 GW of total capacity, and the state's supply chain development strategy aims to capture manufacturing and maintenance jobs.

### What climate resources are available for Virginia farmers?

Virginia's agricultural community can access USDA NRCS cost-share programs (EQIP, CSP) for conservation practices that build climate resilience—cover crops, no-till, riparian buffers, and irrigation efficiency. The Virginia Department of Agriculture's Agricultural BMP Cost-Share Program provides state matching funds. Virginia Tech's Climate Extension program offers technical assistance on heat-tolerant crop varieties, water management, and carbon market participation. The Chesapeake Bay Program's agricultural provisions provide additional funding for Bay watershed farms.
