## Climate Snapshot

Savannah, Georgia, home to approximately 150,000 residents in the city and 400,000 in the metro area, sits along the Savannah River just 18 miles from the Atlantic Ocean. The city's celebrated historic district occupies a bluff roughly 40 feet above sea level, but much of the surrounding metro—including the industrial corridor, port facilities, and residential neighborhoods in West Savannah, Thunderbolt, and the Islands—lies at elevations between 5 and 15 feet.

The Georgia coast is one of the most rapidly changing shorelines in the Southeast. Sea levels at Fort Pulaski have risen 12 inches since 1935, and tidal flooding has increased from 3 days per year in the 1990s to over 20 days per year by 2023. Hurricane Matthew in 2016 brought a 12-foot storm surge to Tybee Island and forced the evacuation of 500,000 Chatham County residents. The storm caused $1.5 billion in damages across coastal Georgia. Hurricane Irma in 2017 flooded downtown Savannah with 3–4 feet of water in some areas, damaging historic structures and shutting down the port for five days.

Savannah's economy is deeply tied to its coast. The Port of Savannah—the fourth-busiest container port in the nation—handles $130 billion in trade annually. Tourism contributes $3.5 billion to the metro economy. Both are exposed to escalating coastal hazards.

## Top Climate Risks

### Sea-Level Rise and Tidal Flooding

Sea-level rise at Savannah's coast is accelerating—projections range from 1 to 2.5 feet by 2060. Tybee Island, Savannah's beach community, faces existential risk: a 2-foot rise would inundate 30% of the island at mean high tide. On the mainland, tidal flooding is expanding into neighborhoods, industrial areas, and transportation corridors that were historically dry. The city's stormwater system, designed for 1980s conditions, backs up during high tides, creating flooding even without rain.

### Hurricanes and Storm Surge

Savannah's coastal position and low elevation make it vulnerable to storm surge from Atlantic hurricanes. A Category 3 hurricane could push 12–18 feet of surge into the Savannah River, flooding the port, industrial facilities, and thousands of homes. The 2016–2017 hurricane sequence demonstrated the city's exposure, with back-to-back evacuations straining resources and community patience.

### Extreme Heat and Precipitation

Savannah's subtropical climate already produces 60+ days above 90°F annually, with projections reaching 85–100 days by 2050. Humidity amplifies heat stress, with heat index values regularly exceeding 110°F. Intense rainfall events have increased 27% in the Southeast since 1958. Savannah's flat topography and high water table mean heavy rain has limited drainage pathways, producing widespread ponding and localized flooding.

## Local Climate Action

Savannah's Sustainability Plan (2019) establishes goals for emissions reduction, green infrastructure, and resilience. The city targets 40% emissions reduction by 2030 and has committed to 100% renewable electricity for city operations by 2035.

The Chatham County–Savannah Metropolitan Planning Commission developed a Sea Level Rise Adaptation Plan in 2020 that identifies vulnerable assets, prioritizes adaptation investments, and integrates sea-level rise projections into zoning and land-use decisions. Tybee Island adopted its own Adaptation Plan, one of the first by a small Georgia community, evaluating living shorelines, beach nourishment, and building elevation strategies.

Savannah is investing $170 million in stormwater infrastructure upgrades over 10 years, including pump station improvements, canal restoration, and green infrastructure in flood-prone neighborhoods. The city's urban forestry program aims to expand tree canopy from 47% to 55% by 2030.

## Regulations & Incentives

Georgia's regulatory approach to climate is measured. The state lacks a comprehensive climate plan but has adopted energy efficiency standards and supports renewable energy development through the Georgia Power solar programs. Georgia Power's Customer-Connected Solar program and community solar offerings provide renewable energy options for Savannah-area customers.

Savannah's floodplain management ordinance requires 2 feet of freeboard above base flood elevation—exceeding FEMA minimums. The city's Historic District zoning overlay adds complexity for resilience retrofits, requiring design review for exterior modifications including flood elevation. Chatham County's Marsh Buffer ordinance protects coastal wetlands that serve as natural flood buffers.

Georgia's commercial Property Assessed Clean Energy (C-PACE) program enables financing for energy efficiency and resilience upgrades. The state offers a solar property tax exemption for residential systems.

## Federal Funding Opportunities

FEMA BRIC and HMGP funds have supported Chatham County flood mitigation projects, including the Tybee Island beach nourishment and residential elevation programs. Georgia received $8.7 million in BRIC funding in 2023.

The Army Corps of Engineers' Savannah Harbor Expansion Project ($973 million, largely complete) deepened the shipping channel, but complementary studies address flood risk management and shoreline protection. NOAA's National Coastal Resilience Fund has supported Georgia coast projects including marsh restoration and living shoreline installations.

IRA incentives provide HEEHRA rebates up to $14,000, 30% solar ITC, and Greenhouse Gas Reduction Fund financing. EPA's Clean Water State Revolving Fund supports Savannah's stormwater infrastructure upgrades. DOT PROTECT formula funding addresses climate-resilient transportation.

## How Council Fire Can Help

Savannah's challenge is protecting irreplaceable historic and economic assets while adapting to accelerating coastal change. Council Fire brings deep expertise in coastal resilience, historic preservation-compatible adaptation, and federal funding strategy.

We help the city and county agencies pursue BRIC, HMGP, and Army Corps funding with competitive applications backed by rigorous benefit-cost analysis. For property owners in the Historic District, Council Fire designs flood mitigation solutions that satisfy both resilience standards and preservation requirements.

Our nature-based solutions practice—living shorelines, wetland restoration, green infrastructure—aligns with Savannah's coastal ecology and provides durable, cost-effective flood risk reduction. Council Fire helps Savannah protect its past while building for its future.

## Frequently Asked Questions

### What are the biggest climate risks facing Savannah?

Sea-level rise and tidal flooding are the primary threats, with flood days increasing from 3 per year in the 1990s to over 20 by 2023. Hurricane storm surge could reach 12–18 feet in a major event, threatening the port, historic district, and thousands of homes. Extreme heat and intense rainfall compound coastal flood risk.

### Does Savannah have a climate action plan?

Savannah's Sustainability Plan targets 40% emissions reduction by 2030. The Chatham County Sea Level Rise Adaptation Plan integrates coastal projections into land-use decisions. Tybee Island has its own adaptation plan. The city is investing $170 million in stormwater infrastructure and expanding urban tree canopy.

### What federal funding is available for climate resilience in Georgia?

Georgia received $8.7 million in FEMA BRIC funding in 2023. HMGP funds support elevation and buyout programs. Army Corps studies address flood risk and shoreline protection. IRA incentives, NOAA coastal resilience grants, and EPA Clean Water funds provide additional streams for Savannah-area projects.
