## Climate Snapshot

Richmond, the capital of Virginia, is home to approximately 230,000 residents in the city proper and over 1.3 million in the metro area. The city straddles the fall line of the James River, where the Piedmont meets the Coastal Plain—a geographic position that concentrates flood risk. Downtown Richmond sits just 15–40 feet above the James, and the Shockoe Bottom neighborhood has flooded repeatedly throughout the city's 400-year history.

In recent decades, the risks have intensified. Hurricane Gaston in 2004 dumped 12 inches of rain on metro Richmond in under 8 hours, causing $18 million in damages and killing eight people in the region. Tropical Storm Michael in 2018 brought widespread wind damage and power outages to 300,000 customers. The summer of 2023 saw Richmond record 42 days above 90°F, well above the historical average of 28, with heat-related emergency calls spiking 35% over the previous five-year average.

Richmond's built environment compounds these risks. Aging stormwater infrastructure, combined sewer overflows that discharge into the James River during heavy rain, and decades of disinvestment in predominantly Black neighborhoods like the East End create uneven exposure to climate hazards.

## Top Climate Risks

### Riverine and Flash Flooding

The James River's watershed drains 10,000 square miles, and Richmond sits at the bottleneck where mountain runoff meets tidal influence. FEMA flood maps place approximately 4,200 properties in the 100-year floodplain. Flash flooding poses an even broader risk—Richmond's hilly terrain channels stormwater rapidly into low-lying areas. The city's combined sewer system, serving roughly 30% of the city, overflows an average of 60–70 times per year, sending an estimated 3 billion gallons of untreated sewage and stormwater into the James annually.

### Extreme Heat

Richmond's urban heat island effect pushes summer temperatures in neighborhoods like Shockoe Bottom, Church Hill, and the East End 8–15°F above surrounding suburban areas. A 2017 study by researchers at Virginia Commonwealth University mapped these disparities, finding strong correlations with historic redlining patterns. By 2050, Richmond could experience 60–80 days above 90°F annually, with nighttime temperatures remaining above 75°F for extended periods—a critical threshold for heat-related illness.

### Severe Storms and Wind Events

Tropical systems tracking up the Atlantic seaboard regularly affect Richmond. Derecho events, including the June 2012 storm that knocked out power to 1 million Virginians, demonstrate the city's vulnerability to straight-line winds. Climate projections indicate a 10–20% increase in precipitation from tropical systems affecting the Mid-Atlantic by 2060.

## Local Climate Action

Richmond adopted its RVAgreen 2050 plan in 2020, committing to an 80% reduction in greenhouse gas emissions and 100% renewable energy for city operations by 2030, with community-wide carbon neutrality by 2050. The plan centers equity, directing at least 50% of climate investments toward historically marginalized communities.

The city's Office of Sustainability coordinates implementation across 15 focus areas, from building energy performance to urban forestry. Richmond has planted over 10,000 trees since 2019 through its urban canopy goal of 60% coverage by 2037 (up from roughly 42%). The city adopted a green infrastructure standard for new development in 2021, requiring on-site stormwater management for projects disturbing more than 2,500 square feet.

Richmond is also investing $300 million over 20 years to separate its combined sewer system, which will eliminate the majority of overflow events and improve James River water quality.

## Regulations & Incentives

Virginia's Clean Economy Act requires Dominion Energy, which serves Richmond, to reach 100% carbon-free electricity by 2045. The state's building energy code was updated in 2021 to align with the 2018 IECC, with further updates pending. Virginia's C-PACE program enables commercial property owners to finance energy efficiency, renewable energy, and resilience improvements.

Richmond's zoning code includes a floodplain overlay district requiring 2 feet of freeboard above base flood elevation for new construction. The city offers a stormwater utility credit program providing up to 50% reduction in fees for properties implementing approved BMPs. Virginia's income tax credit for solar installations (up to $1,000) and property tax exemption for solar equipment complement federal ITC incentives.

The state's Resilient Virginia Revolving Loan Fund provides below-market financing for flood mitigation projects in participating communities.

## Federal Funding Opportunities

The IRA delivers significant benefits to Richmond-area residents and businesses. HEEHRA provides up to $14,000 per household for electrification upgrades, with enhanced rebates for LMI households. The 25C tax credit covers 30% of costs for heat pumps, insulation, and efficient HVAC systems. The 48C Advanced Energy Project Credit has funded manufacturing facility upgrades in the Richmond metro.

FEMA's BRIC program awarded Virginia $22 million in its 2023 cycle, with Hampton Roads and Central Virginia projects among the recipients. The Flood Mitigation Assistance program specifically targets repetitive-loss properties—Richmond has over 300 properties on FEMA's repetitive loss list.

EPA's Clean Water State Revolving Fund supports Richmond's combined sewer separation project. HUD CDBG formula grants fund housing rehabilitation and infrastructure improvements in low-income neighborhoods facing disproportionate climate risk.

## How Council Fire Can Help

Richmond's climate challenges sit at the intersection of aging infrastructure, environmental justice, and regulatory evolution. Council Fire helps city agencies, utilities, developers, and nonprofits align their resilience investments with available funding and regulatory requirements.

For the city's combined sewer separation effort, we provide project management support and federal funding strategy. For developers working in the floodplain overlay district, Council Fire delivers risk assessments and design solutions that exceed minimum standards while controlling costs.

Our environmental justice expertise supports Richmond's commitment to equitable climate investment. We help community organizations and municipal departments build competitive grant applications for BRIC, EPA, and HUD programs that prioritize underserved communities. Council Fire brings the technical rigor and strategic vision to help Richmond adapt at the pace its risks demand.

## Frequently Asked Questions

### What are the biggest climate risks facing Richmond?

Riverine and flash flooding from the James River and its tributaries are Richmond's primary climate risk, compounded by an aging combined sewer system that overflows dozens of times annually. Extreme heat is an escalating threat, with strong disparities tied to historic redlining. Severe storms, including tropical systems and derechos, cause recurring wind and water damage.

### Does Richmond have a climate action plan?

Yes. RVAgreen 2050, adopted in 2020, targets 80% emissions reduction and 100% renewable energy for city operations by 2030, with community-wide carbon neutrality by 2050. The plan centers equity, directing at least half of climate investments to historically marginalized communities. The city is also investing $300 million to separate its combined sewer system.

### What federal funding is available for climate resilience in Virginia?

Virginia accesses FEMA BRIC and FMA grants, EPA Clean Water State Revolving Fund loans, HUD CDBG and disaster recovery funding, IRA electrification rebates and tax credits, and DOT PROTECT formula funding. The state received $22 million in BRIC funding in 2023. Richmond's repetitive-loss properties qualify for targeted FMA assistance.
