## Climate Snapshot

Key West sits at the end of a 113-mile chain of islands connected by the Overseas Highway (US-1), making it one of the most geographically isolated cities in the continental United States. The island's highest natural elevation is 18 feet at Solares Hill, but the vast majority of the city lies below 5 feet above sea level. With 25,000 year-round residents, a $2.5 billion annual tourism economy, and a single evacuation route, Key West faces an existential climate challenge.

The Key West tide gauge—operating continuously since 1913—is one of the longest-running in the Western Hemisphere and shows approximately 11 inches of sea level rise over the past century, accelerating to roughly 4 mm per year in recent decades. The Southeast Florida Regional Climate Change Compact (which includes Monroe County) projects 10 to 17 inches of additional rise by 2040 and 21 to 54 inches by 2060.

Hurricane Irma (2017) struck the Lower Keys as a Category 4 storm, pushing 5–8 feet of surge through Key West and causing over $1 billion in damage to Monroe County. The storm destroyed or severely damaged 25% of the housing stock in the Keys, triggering a housing crisis that persists years later due to the cost and complexity of rebuilding to modern code on a low-lying island.

## Top Climate Risks

### Sea Level Rise & Permanent Inundation

At current projections, 2–3 feet of sea level rise would permanently inundate roads, utilities, and properties across significant portions of Key West. The island's porous limestone geology—identical to Fort Lauderdale's—means rising seas push groundwater up through the rock, flooding from below. The city's septic systems (serving roughly 30% of properties) are already compromised by high groundwater, creating public health and water quality concerns.

### Hurricanes & Evacuation Constraints

The Keys' single evacuation route (US-1) requires a 48-hour evacuation notice for Monroe County, the longest lead time in Florida. Traffic modeling shows that full evacuation of the Keys takes 24–36 hours under ideal conditions. Climate models project hurricanes will intensify more rapidly, reducing the warning time available. A fast-developing Category 4 or 5 storm could make safe evacuation impossible.

### Coral Reef Decline & Marine Ecosystem Collapse

The Florida Keys coral reef tract—the third-largest barrier reef system in the world—has lost over 90% of its living coral cover since the 1970s. Ocean warming, acidification, disease (particularly stony coral tissue loss disease since 2014), and pollution have driven catastrophic decline. In summer 2023, water temperatures in the Keys exceeded 100°F at some monitoring stations, causing mass coral bleaching. The reef provides storm wave attenuation estimated at $1.8 billion annually; its loss directly increases flood risk on shore.

## Local Climate Action

Monroe County's Comprehensive Plan and the City of Key West's Sustainability and Climate Action Plan (2022) both address sea level rise with aggressive building standards and land use policies. The county requires all new construction to be elevated to BFE plus 2 feet of freeboard, with the city adopting BFE plus 3 feet for its jurisdiction.

The city has invested $100 million in a centralized sewer system to replace failing septic tanks, with Phase 5 completion in 2024. This is both a water quality initiative and a climate adaptation measure, as septic systems fail as groundwater rises.

The Keys' Rate of Growth Ordinance (ROGO) limits new residential development to approximately 200 units per year across the county, effectively managing population growth in the face of shrinking habitable land. The ROGO system was originally adopted for hurricane evacuation capacity but now serves a climate adaptation function.

## Regulations & Incentives

Monroe County's comprehensive plan policies prohibit new development seaward of the Coastal High Hazard Area boundary and require all habitable floors to be elevated above BFE plus freeboard. The county's post-Irma building requirement raised the substantial improvement threshold review from 50% to include cumulative improvements over a 10-year period.

Florida's My Safe Florida Home program and PACE financing are available in the Keys. The Florida Keys Electric Cooperative (FKEC) offers net metering and solar interconnection programs, though the cooperative's small scale limits utility-scale renewable development.

The Florida Keys National Marine Sanctuary regulations restrict certain activities that could damage reef and marine habitat, with implications for waterfront development and construction.

## Federal Funding Opportunities

FEMA HMGP funding post-Irma has supported over $150 million in Keys mitigation projects, including property elevation, wind retrofit, and infrastructure hardening. The FMA program funds repetitive-loss property mitigation.

NOAA's Coral Reef Conservation Program and the National Fish and Wildlife Foundation provide grants for reef restoration, resilience research, and water quality improvement. The $16 million Mission: Iconic Reefs initiative is actively restoring seven reef sites in the Florida Keys.

EPA's Water Infrastructure Finance and Innovation Act (WIFIA) program has funded Monroe County's wastewater infrastructure improvements, with low-interest loans exceeding $50 million.

The DOT's RAISE and INFRA programs are relevant for Overseas Highway resilience projects, including bridge elevation and roadway hardening. The highway's vulnerability to sea level rise and storm damage makes it a strong candidate for federal resilient infrastructure investment.

## How Council Fire Can Help

Council Fire works with Keys communities on the intersection of climate adaptation, historic preservation, and sustainable development that defines the island chain's resilience challenge. We support Monroe County and Key West with hazard mitigation planning, FEMA grant administration, and long-term adaptation strategy for an environment where retreat may eventually be necessary.

Our water resources practice supports wastewater and stormwater infrastructure planning in the Keys' constrained island environment. For hospitality and commercial clients, we provide climate risk assessment, business continuity planning, and sustainability certifications that resonate with the Keys' eco-tourism market.

## Frequently Asked Questions

### Will Key West be underwater?

At current sea level rise rates, Key West will not be "underwater" in the near term, but the city will experience progressively worsening tidal flooding, groundwater intrusion, and storm vulnerability. Under the Compact's intermediate-high projection (54 inches by 2060), large portions of the island would flood daily at high tide. The timeline for when the island becomes functionally uninhabitable depends on the rate of sea level rise, investments in adaptation infrastructure, and the threshold at which residents and businesses decide the cost of staying exceeds the cost of relocating.

### How did Hurricane Irma affect the Keys?

Hurricane Irma (September 2017) struck the Lower Keys as a Category 4 storm with 130 mph winds and 5–8 feet of storm surge. Monroe County sustained over $1 billion in damage. Approximately 25% of the Keys' housing stock was destroyed or severely damaged—4,000+ units. The Overseas Highway was impassable for days. Recovery took years, and the resulting housing shortage drove up costs in an already expensive market, forcing many service-industry workers to leave the island chain.

### What is happening to the coral reef?

The Florida Keys reef tract has lost over 90% of its living coral since the 1970s due to warming waters, ocean acidification, disease, and water quality degradation. Stony coral tissue loss disease, first observed in 2014, has spread along the entire reef tract and caused significant mortality in critical species. Record ocean temperatures in 2023 (exceeding 100°F at some stations) triggered mass bleaching. NOAA's Mission: Iconic Reefs program and university-led coral nursery efforts are working to propagate heat-tolerant coral varieties, but the scale of decline far outpaces restoration capacity.
