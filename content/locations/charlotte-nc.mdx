## Climate Snapshot

Charlotte is North Carolina's largest city, with a population of approximately 897,000 and a metro area exceeding 2.7 million. Located in the southern Piedmont, Charlotte sits on a gently rolling landscape drained by dozens of creeks feeding into the Catawba River system. The city's explosive growth—it added over 100,000 residents between 2018 and 2024—has dramatically expanded impervious surface coverage and stretched stormwater infrastructure beyond its design capacity.

Hurricane Helene in September 2024 brought catastrophic flooding to western North Carolina, and Charlotte experienced significant impacts as well, with over 7 inches of rain in 24 hours overwhelming creeks across the city. Briar Creek, Little Sugar Creek, and McAlpine Creek all exceeded their banks, flooding hundreds of homes and businesses. Mecklenburg County estimated damages at $85 million. This followed Hurricane Florence in 2018, which caused $45 million in damages in the Charlotte metro, and a May 2024 thunderstorm complex that dropped 5 inches of rain in 90 minutes on the south side, flooding I-485 and stranding motorists.

Charlotte's heat profile is intensifying. The city recorded its hottest year on record in 2023, with an average temperature 2.8°F above the 1991-2020 normal. The urban core regularly hits temperatures 8-10°F higher than surrounding rural areas due to extensive pavement and limited tree canopy in commercial corridors.

## Top Climate Risks

### Urban Flooding
Charlotte's hydrology—over 3,000 miles of streams and creeks within Mecklenburg County—creates pervasive flood risk. Charlotte-Mecklenburg Storm Water Services has identified over 8,500 structures in the 100-year floodplain, with a combined value exceeding $4 billion. The county's floodplain mapping program, one of the most advanced in the nation, has documented that actual flood risk extends well beyond FEMA-mapped zones. Since 2000, the county has spent over $300 million on floodplain buyouts, acquiring more than 700 flood-prone properties. Climate projections suggest extreme rainfall events will intensify by 15-25% by 2060.

### Extreme Heat
Charlotte experienced 56 days above 90°F in 2023 and recorded its first-ever 105°F reading in June 2024. A 2022 Trust for Public Land analysis ranked Charlotte among the 10 worst large U.S. cities for urban heat island disparity, with historically redlined neighborhoods averaging 7°F hotter than wealthy areas. Tree canopy coverage has declined from 47% in 2012 to approximately 42% in 2023, driven by development. Heat-related emergency calls in Mecklenburg County rose 52% between 2019 and 2023.

### Severe Thunderstorms and Wind Events
Charlotte's position in the southern Piedmont makes it susceptible to severe convective storms from March through September. The March 2021 tornado outbreak sent an EF-2 tornado through south Charlotte, damaging 200+ structures. Microbursts and derechos have caused repeated, widespread power outages—a December 2022 winter storm knocked out electricity to 400,000 Duke Energy customers in the Charlotte region for up to five days, exposing the grid's vulnerability to extreme weather.

## Local Climate Action

Charlotte adopted its Strategic Energy Action Plan (SEAP) in 2018, updated in 2022, with a goal of achieving community-wide carbon neutrality by 2050. The city's interim targets include a 35% emissions reduction by 2030 from a 2011 baseline. Charlotte's SEAP focuses on transportation (the largest emissions sector at 42%), buildings, and energy supply.

The city launched its Tree Canopy Action Plan in 2022, targeting 50% canopy coverage by 2040 through accelerated planting and stronger preservation ordinances. Charlotte's CATS transit system is expanding its electric bus fleet, with 62 electric buses ordered for delivery by 2026, replacing diesel on high-ridership routes.

In 2023, Charlotte City Council approved a building performance standard for commercial buildings over 25,000 square feet, requiring energy benchmarking and disclosure starting in 2025, with performance targets phasing in by 2030. The city's municipal operations achieved 100% renewable electricity in 2023 through Duke Energy's Green Source Advantage program.

## Regulations & Incentives

North Carolina's HB 951 mandates a 70% carbon reduction from the power sector by 2030 and carbon neutrality by 2050, directly benefiting Charlotte by driving cleaner grid electricity. Duke Energy, headquartered in Charlotte, offers net metering, a PowerPair solar-plus-battery rebate of $3,000, and time-of-use rate structures that incentivize demand flexibility.

Mecklenburg County's stormwater fee provides credits of up to 50% for properties installing approved BMPs. Charlotte's Commercial Building Performance Standards will require covered buildings to reduce energy use intensity by 20% by 2030. The city offers expedited permitting for LEED-certified or Energy Star-certified projects.

North Carolina's Weatherization Assistance Program serves income-eligible households with up to $8,009 per unit in efficiency improvements. The state's solar access law prevents HOAs from prohibiting solar panel installations, a significant enabler in Charlotte's HOA-heavy suburban landscape.

## Federal Funding Opportunities

North Carolina's IRA allocation for Home Energy Rebates totals $262 million. Charlotte residents can access up to $8,000 for heat pump installations and $14,000 for low-income households through HEEHR. Federal tax credits cover 30% of solar, battery storage, and energy efficiency upgrades through 2032.

FEMA's BRIC program has been transformative for Charlotte-Mecklenburg. The county has received over $28 million in cumulative BRIC and pre-disaster mitigation funding since 2020, primarily for floodplain buyouts along Briar Creek and McAlpine Creek. The $1 billion annual BRIC allocation continues to fund Charlotte's nationally recognized buyout program.

The EPA's Climate Pollution Reduction Grants provided the Charlotte region with planning funds, and implementation grants of up to $500 million are available competitively. The DOT's RAISE grants have supported Charlotte's transit electrification, with a $25 million award in 2023 for the CATS electric bus expansion. USDA Urban Forestry grants from the IRA's $1.5 billion allocation support Charlotte's tree canopy goals.
