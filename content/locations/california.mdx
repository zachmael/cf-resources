## Climate Snapshot

California's 39 million residents and $4 trillion economy occupy a state defined by climate extremes. From the foggy redwood coast to the desert floor of Death Valley, California contains more climate diversity than most nations—and more climate risk. The state has warmed approximately 2.5°F since 1900, with the Sierra Nevada snowpack (which supplies 30% of the state's water) declining roughly 20% over the past 50 years.

The 2020–2022 drought was the driest three-year period in California's recorded history. It was immediately followed by atmospheric river events in January 2023 that caused $5.6 billion in damage and killed 22 people—a whiplash between extremes that climate scientists project will define California's future. Meanwhile, the 2020 wildfire season burned over 4.2 million acres (a record), and the 2025 Los Angeles fires demonstrated that no part of the state is immune.

California has responded with the most aggressive climate policy framework in the nation, including a commitment to carbon neutrality by 2045, a ban on new gas vehicle sales by 2035, and building decarbonization mandates. This policy leadership creates both compliance obligations and economic opportunities that affect every sector.

## Top Climate Risks

### Wildfire

California has experienced 7 of its 10 largest fires in recorded history since 2017. The Camp Fire (2018) destroyed the town of Paradise and killed 85 people. The 2025 Palisades and Eaton fires in Los Angeles County caused unprecedented urban-wildland interface destruction. Over 3.6 million California homes are in high or very high fire hazard severity zones. Wildfire insurance availability has collapsed in many areas, with the FAIR Plan (insurer of last resort) growing to over 400,000 policies.

### Drought & Water Supply

California's water supply system—built for a 20th-century climate—cannot reliably meet 21st-century demand. The Sierra snowpack that feeds the Central Valley Project and State Water Project is declining as more precipitation falls as rain instead of snow. Groundwater overdraft, particularly in the San Joaquin Valley, has caused land to subside by 28 feet in some areas—damaging canals, roads, and wells. The Sustainable Groundwater Management Act (SGMA) requires overdrafted basins to reach sustainability by 2040, potentially fallowing 500,000–800,000 acres of farmland.

### Sea Level Rise & Coastal Erosion

California's Ocean Protection Council projects 3.5 feet of sea level rise by 2100 under the state's planning scenario, with a possibility of over 6 feet if Antarctic ice sheet dynamics worsen. The state's $30 billion coastal tourism economy, critical transportation infrastructure (Highway 1, Pacific Coast Railroad), and dense coastal development face increasing erosion and flood risk. San Francisco Bay Area communities are coordinating on a $100 billion adaptation challenge.

## Local Climate Action

AB 32 (Global Warming Solutions Act, 2006), SB 32 (2016), and AB 1279 (2022) establish California's emissions reduction trajectory: 40% below 1990 levels by 2030 and carbon neutrality by 2045. The state's cap-and-trade program—one of the world's largest—generated $5.4 billion in auction revenue in FY2024, funding climate investments across transportation, housing, natural resources, and agriculture.

California's Title 24 Building Energy Efficiency Standards (2022 update) require all-electric new construction, rooftop solar on commercial buildings, and battery storage readiness. The state's Advanced Clean Cars II regulation bans new gasoline vehicle sales starting in 2035.

CalFire's Wildfire and Forest Resilience Strategy targets treatment of 500,000 acres annually through prescribed fire, forest thinning, and defensible space programs. The state invested $2.8 billion in wildfire resilience between 2020 and 2024.

## Regulations & Incentives

California's regulatory framework for climate and sustainability is the most extensive in the nation. Key requirements include: SB 253 (corporate climate disclosure for companies with $1B+ revenue), SB 261 (climate risk reporting), AB 1279 (carbon neutrality mandate), Title 24 building standards, SGMA groundwater sustainability, and the Low Carbon Fuel Standard.

The state offers extensive incentives: Self-Generation Incentive Program (SGIP) for battery storage, California Solar Initiative rebates, Clean Vehicle Rebate Project (up to $7,000 for EVs), PACE financing for commercial and residential energy/resilience, and cap-and-trade funded programs including Affordable Housing and Sustainable Communities, Transit and Intercity Rail, and the Community Air Protection Program.

The California Energy Commission's Equitable Building Decarbonization Program provides incentives for low-income building electrification and efficiency upgrades.

## Federal Funding Opportunities

California leads states in IRA and BIL funding, with over $50 billion in allocations across clean energy tax credits, EV infrastructure, grid modernization, and climate resilience. The state's California Infrastructure and Economic Development Bank (IBank) leverages federal funds with state and private capital.

FEMA's BRIC program has awarded over $100 million to California projects, primarily for wildfire mitigation and flood infrastructure. The state's HMGP allocations from multiple disaster declarations fund ongoing hazard mitigation.

The Bureau of Reclamation's WaterSMART program and the USDA's EQIP provide significant funding for California's water efficiency, recycling, and agricultural conservation programs. The Army Corps manages over $3 billion in active California flood risk management projects.

DOE's Loan Programs Office has provided over $10 billion in loan guarantees for California clean energy projects, and the state hosts multiple DOE national lab partnerships through Lawrence Berkeley, Lawrence Livermore, and Sandia.

Council Fire supports California clients navigating the nation's most complex climate regulatory environment. We provide corporate climate disclosure compliance (SB 253/261), building decarbonization planning, and wildfire resilience strategy for communities, utilities, and commercial property owners.

Our water resources practice addresses California's supply challenges through SGMA compliance, recycled water program development, and agricultural water efficiency planning. For real estate and development clients, we navigate Title 24 compliance, green building certification, and climate risk assessment in an increasingly regulated market.

## Frequently Asked Questions

### What does California's carbon neutrality by 2045 mean for businesses?

AB 1279 sets a statewide goal of carbon neutrality by 2045 and 85% emissions reduction below 1990 levels. While the law applies to the state as a whole rather than individual businesses, the implementing regulations—through CARB's Scoping Plan—will tighten cap-and-trade, electrification mandates, and clean fuel standards progressively through 2045. Large companies also face disclosure requirements under SB 253 (Scope 1, 2, and 3 emissions) and SB 261 (climate risk reporting). Early action on decarbonization reduces regulatory and financial risk.

### How is California addressing the wildfire insurance crisis?

The state is pursuing multiple strategies: Insurance Commissioner Lara's Sustainable Insurance Strategy requires insurers to offer coverage in wildfire-prone areas in exchange for using catastrophe models (rather than historical loss data) for pricing and including reinsurance costs in rates. The FAIR Plan—the insurer of last resort—has expanded coverage limits and is being restructured to improve solvency. Community wildfire hardening programs (Firewise USA, home hardening retrofits) can reduce premiums. Despite these efforts, availability and affordability remain severe challenges in high-risk areas.

### What is SGMA and how does it affect California agriculture?

The Sustainable Groundwater Management Act (2014) requires critically overdrafted groundwater basins to achieve sustainability by 2040 and all other basins by 2042. This may require fallowing 500,000–800,000 acres of San Joaquin Valley farmland to reduce pumping. The economic impact could exceed $7 billion annually. Strategies to minimize fallowing include water recycling, managed aquifer recharge, demand reduction, and water trading. The act represents the most significant change to California water management in a century.

### How much has California invested in climate action?

California has invested over $50 billion in climate-related programs since 2020, including $15 billion in the Climate Commitment Package (2022), $2.8 billion in wildfire resilience, $10 billion in zero-emission vehicle infrastructure, and ongoing cap-and-trade funded investments averaging $5 billion annually. Federal IRA and BIL funding adds tens of billions more. This combined state-federal investment is the largest climate spending program of any subnational government in the world.
