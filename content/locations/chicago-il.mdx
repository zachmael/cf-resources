## Climate Snapshot

Chicago is the third-largest city in the United States, with 2.7 million residents and a metro population exceeding 9.4 million. Situated on the southwestern shore of Lake Michigan, the city's climate is shaped by lake-effect weather patterns, harsh winters, and increasingly intense summer heat. Chicago's flat topography, aging infrastructure, and dense urban core make it particularly vulnerable to stormwater flooding and extreme heat events.

The July 1995 heat wave remains the deadliest weather event in Chicago's modern history, killing an estimated 739 people over five days when temperatures hit 106°F with heat indices above 120°F. More recently, the city has experienced a surge in severe flooding. In July 2023, intense storms dropped over 5 inches of rain in parts of the metro, flooding basements across the South and West Sides and causing an estimated $75 million in damages. Between 2007 and 2022, Chicago received more FEMA flood claims than any other U.S. city outside of hurricane-prone coastal areas—over 110,000 claims totaling $470 million.

Lake Michigan water levels have swung dramatically, hitting record highs in 2020 that eroded shoreline and damaged lakefront infrastructure, then dropping again. Climate models project Chicago will experience 20-30 more days above 90°F annually by mid-century, along with 15-20% more precipitation during extreme rainfall events.

## Top Climate Risks

### Urban Flooding
Chicago's combined sewer system serves roughly 75% of the city, and it was designed for rainfall intensities far below current norms. Basement flooding affects an estimated 200,000 properties across the city. The Tunnel and Reservoir Plan (TARP, or "Deep Tunnel") has invested over $4 billion since the 1970s to capture stormwater, but the system's full capacity of 20.6 billion gallons won't be reached until the McCook Reservoir's final stage is completed in 2029. Meanwhile, the South and West Sides—predominantly Black and Latino neighborhoods—bear the heaviest flood burden, with FEMA payouts in these areas running 3-4x the citywide average.

### Extreme Heat
Chicago's urban heat island effect raises temperatures in dense neighborhoods by 10-15°F compared to surrounding suburbs. The city now averages 18 days per year above 90°F, up from 12 in the 1970s. Projections from the Great Lakes Integrated Sciences and Assessments Center indicate this could reach 45 days by 2050 under a high-emissions scenario. Heat-related deaths disproportionately affect elderly residents, particularly in neighborhoods with less tree canopy and more impervious surface. The city's canopy cover ranges from under 10% in some South Side neighborhoods to over 30% on the North Side.

### Lake Michigan Variability
Lake Michigan's water levels hit all-time highs in 2020, causing $500 million in shoreline erosion and infrastructure damage along Chicago's 26 miles of lakefront. Rapid fluctuations—the lake swung from near-record lows in 2013 to record highs in 2020—make long-term infrastructure planning difficult. Lakefront parks, bike paths, and the critical water intake infrastructure all face ongoing risk.

## Local Climate Action

Chicago's 2022 Climate Action Plan set targets of 62% greenhouse gas reduction by 2040 and carbon neutrality by 2050. The plan identifies 30 strategies across buildings, transportation, energy, and waste. The city committed to transitioning its municipal fleet to 100% electric vehicles by 2035 and sourcing 100% renewable electricity for city operations by 2025.

The Chicago Resilient Corridors initiative targets six neighborhoods for integrated green infrastructure investments—bioswales, permeable pavement, rain gardens, and urban tree planting along commercial corridors in Austin, Englewood, Auburn Gresham, South Chicago, Chatham, and Pullman. The city allocated $188 million in American Rescue Plan funds for climate-related infrastructure in 2022-2023.

Chicago's Building Decarbonization Ordinance, passed in 2023, requires buildings over 50,000 square feet to meet energy performance standards or face escalating fines starting in 2026.

## Regulations & Incentives

Illinois' Climate and Equitable Jobs Act (CEJA), signed in 2021, mandates 100% clean energy by 2045 and allocates $580 million for clean energy workforce training and equity programs. The state's Adjustable Block Program provides solar renewable energy credits worth $70-$90 per MWh for distributed solar installations.

Chicago's energy benchmarking ordinance requires commercial and residential buildings over 50,000 square feet to report energy use annually. The Green Stormwater Infrastructure Strategy offers incentives for private property owners who install permeable surfaces, rain gardens, or green roofs—rebates range from $2 to $6 per square foot of managed impervious area.

ComEd, the regional utility, offers rebates of up to $4,500 for residential heat pump installations and up to $2,000 for insulation upgrades through the Illinois Energy Efficiency programs.

## Federal Funding Opportunities

The IRA allocates Illinois an estimated $156 million through the Home Electrification and Appliance Rebates program, with individual households eligible for up to $14,000 in rebates. The Home Efficiency Rebates program offers up to $8,000 for whole-home energy improvements.

FEMA's BRIC program awarded Illinois $34.7 million in 2023, with a significant portion targeting flood mitigation in the Chicago metro. The Safeguarding Tomorrow through Ongoing Risk Mitigation (STORM) Act enables revolving loan funds for state and local hazard mitigation projects.

HUD's CDBG program provides Chicago with approximately $90 million annually, portions of which can be directed toward climate resilience. The EPA's Water Infrastructure Finance and Innovation Act (WIFIA) has provided $336 million for TARP-related projects. The DOT's PROTECT grants offer formula and competitive funding for resilient transportation infrastructure.

## How Council Fire Can Help

Council Fire partners with Midwest cities to address the compounding challenges of aging infrastructure, environmental justice, and climate adaptation. In Chicago, our work centers on helping neighborhoods most impacted by flooding and heat develop community-driven resilience plans. We support grant writing and management for BRIC, IRA, and CEJA-funded programs, conduct building-level vulnerability assessments, and design green infrastructure strategies that deliver flood reduction, heat mitigation, and workforce development benefits simultaneously.

Our team understands the political and institutional landscape of large-city climate work. We help bridge the gap between ambitious citywide targets and neighborhood-level implementation, ensuring that investments reach the South and West Side communities that need them most.

## Frequently Asked Questions

### What are the biggest climate risks facing Chicago?
Urban flooding is Chicago's most costly and widespread climate risk, with over 110,000 FEMA flood claims filed between 2007 and 2022—more than any non-coastal U.S. city. Extreme heat is the deadliest risk, with the 1995 heat wave killing 739 people. Lake Michigan's volatile water levels also threaten shoreline infrastructure. All three risks hit hardest in low-income communities of color on the South and West Sides.

### Does Chicago have a climate action plan?
Yes. Chicago's 2022 Climate Action Plan targets 62% greenhouse gas reduction by 2040 and carbon neutrality by 2050. Key initiatives include the Building Decarbonization Ordinance (performance standards for large buildings starting 2026), the Resilient Corridors green infrastructure program in six South and West Side neighborhoods, and a commitment to 100% renewable electricity for city operations.

### What federal funding is available for climate resilience in Illinois?
Illinois has access to $156 million in IRA home electrification rebates, $34.7 million from FEMA's BRIC program (2023 cycle), and ongoing WIFIA loans for water infrastructure. The state's CEJA legislation unlocked $580 million in clean energy workforce and equity funding. Chicago also receives roughly $90 million annually in HUD CDBG funds, portions of which support resilience projects.

### Why does basement flooding disproportionately affect Chicago's South and West Sides?
These neighborhoods have less green space, more impervious surface, and older stormwater infrastructure compared to the North Side. Decades of disinvestment mean fewer trees, less maintained sewers, and housing stock more vulnerable to water intrusion. FEMA flood payouts in South and West Side zip codes run 3-4x the citywide average. The city's Resilient Corridors initiative targets these areas for green infrastructure investment to begin addressing the disparity.
