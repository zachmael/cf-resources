## Climate Snapshot

Honolulu, the capital of Hawaii, is home to approximately 350,000 residents in the city and 1 million on the island of Oahu—nearly 70% of the state's population concentrated on a single island. The city stretches along Oahu's south shore, from Pearl Harbor to Diamond Head, with dense urban development packed between the Ko'olau mountain range and the Pacific Ocean. Waikiki, the state's economic engine generating $2 billion in annual tourism revenue, sits on a narrow strip of reclaimed and natural beach averaging just 3 feet above sea level.

Hawaii is already experiencing the effects of climate change. Sea levels at Honolulu Harbor have risen 6 inches since 1950, and king tide events increasingly flood streets in Waikiki, Mapunapuna, and the airport district. In December 2021, a kona storm dropped 10 inches of rain on East Honolulu in 12 hours, triggering flash floods and mudslides that caused $20 million in damages and collapsed a hillside retaining wall in Hawaii Kai.

The state's isolation compounds every climate risk. Hawaii imports 85–90% of its food and nearly all fossil fuels. A major disruption to port or airport operations—whether from a hurricane, tsunami, or pandemic—threatens the basic supply chain. Hurricane Lane in 2018 passed within 100 miles of Oahu, dropping 52 inches of rain on the Big Island and causing $150 million in damages statewide. A direct hit on Honolulu would be catastrophic.

## Top Climate Risks

### Sea-Level Rise and Coastal Erosion

The Hawaii Climate Change Mitigation and Adaptation Commission projects 3.2 feet of sea-level rise by 2100, with significant impacts visible by 2050. A 1-foot rise would chronically flood portions of Waikiki, inundate the Honolulu International Airport's low-lying areas, and accelerate erosion across 70% of Oahu's beaches. Waikiki alone contains $19 billion in assessed property value within 3 feet of current sea level. Beach loss threatens Hawaii's $17 billion tourism industry at its core.

### Hurricanes and Tropical Storms

While direct hurricane hits on Hawaii are rare, the risk is increasing. Central Pacific hurricane activity has risen as ocean temperatures warm. Hurricane Lane (2018) and Hurricane Douglas (2020), which passed within 30 miles of Oahu, demonstrated that near-misses are becoming more frequent. A Category 3+ direct hit on Honolulu would cause an estimated $40–60 billion in damages given the island's concentrated development and limited evacuation options.

### Flash Flooding and Landslides

Oahu's steep terrain and tropical rainfall patterns produce rapid, dangerous flash floods. The Ko'olau mountains receive 200+ inches of rain annually on their windward faces, with intense storms sending torrents through urbanized valleys. The April 2018 Kauai flood (49 inches in 24 hours) demonstrated the extreme rainfall potential in the Hawaiian Islands. Climate models project a 5–10% increase in extreme precipitation intensity in Hawaii by 2050.

## Local Climate Action

Hawaii's climate ambition is unmatched among U.S. states. HB 2182 (2018) commits the state to 100% carbon neutrality by 2045, and Act 97 (2015) mandates 100% renewable electricity by 2045—the first state in the nation to set that target. Hawaiian Electric's integrated resource plans project achieving the target primarily through rooftop solar, utility-scale solar-plus-storage, and offshore wind.

Honolulu's Climate Action Plan (2021) targets carbon neutrality for city operations by 2025 and community-wide by 2045. The city has invested in a rapid transit project (Skyline, $12.4 billion) connecting West Oahu to downtown, electric bus deployment, and energy efficiency programs for municipal buildings.

The Hawaii Sea Level Rise Vulnerability and Adaptation Report (2017) identifies 6,500 structures and 25,800 residents in the Sea-Level Rise Exposure Area on Oahu. The city's updated Shoreline Setback Ordinance requires new structures to be set back from the certified shoreline based on erosion rates, with additional setbacks for sea-level rise.

## Regulations & Incentives

Hawaii's regulatory framework is aggressive. Act 15 (2022) mandates climate risk disclosure for real estate transactions. The state's building energy code follows the 2021 IECC with Hawaii-specific amendments. All new single-family homes must include solar water heating (since 2010) and solar PV or equivalent (since 2022).

Hawaiian Electric offers robust incentives for battery storage (critical given the grid's high solar penetration and evening peak demand), EV charging, and demand response. The state's Green Energy Market Securitization (GEMS) program provides low-interest financing for solar and efficiency projects, targeting renters and low-income households.

Honolulu's Special Management Area (SMA) permit process regulates coastal development, requiring environmental assessments and climate risk analysis for projects within the coastal zone.

## Federal Funding Opportunities

IRA incentives are especially impactful in Hawaii, where electricity costs average $0.35/kWh—the highest in the nation. The 30% solar and storage ITC, HEEHRA rebates up to $14,000, and clean vehicle credits accelerate Hawaii's energy transition. EPA Greenhouse Gas Reduction Fund awards support clean energy financing.

FEMA BRIC and FMA programs fund flood and erosion mitigation projects. Hawaii received $3.8 million in BRIC funding in 2023. NOAA's National Coastal Resilience Fund supports beach nourishment, coral reef restoration, and nature-based shoreline stabilization. The Army Corps' Waikiki Beach Erosion Control Project addresses sand loss along Honolulu's most valuable coastline.

The DOT PROTECT program provides formula funding for climate-resilient transportation. The DOI's Coastal Barrier Resources System and National Wildlife Refuge programs support natural coastal defense. Post-wildfire recovery funding from the 2023 Maui fires has accelerated federal engagement across the state.

## How Council Fire Can Help

Hawaii's island geography concentrates climate risk and amplifies the consequences of every disruption. Council Fire helps state and local agencies, resorts, developers, and military installations build resilience strategies calibrated to island-specific constraints.

For coastal property owners and resort operators, we provide sea-level rise vulnerability assessments, shoreline adaptation design, and SMA permit support. For agencies pursuing federal funding, Council Fire delivers BRIC, NOAA, and Army Corps grant applications with compelling benefit-cost analyses.

Our energy resilience practice supports Hawaii's renewable transition with microgrid design, battery storage optimization, and IRA incentive navigation. Council Fire brings the interdisciplinary expertise that island resilience demands—connecting energy, water, coastal, and supply chain risks into integrated strategies.

## Frequently Asked Questions

### What are the biggest climate risks facing Honolulu?

Sea-level rise and coastal erosion threaten Waikiki's $19 billion in property and Hawaii's $17 billion tourism industry. Hurricane risk is increasing as Central Pacific waters warm. Flash flooding from intense tropical rainfall events causes recurring damage in Oahu's steep valleys and urbanized lowlands.

### Does Honolulu have a climate action plan?

Yes. Hawaii targets 100% renewable electricity by 2045 and statewide carbon neutrality by 2045. Honolulu's plan targets carbon-neutral city operations by 2025. The Skyline rapid transit project, updated shoreline setback ordinances, and mandatory solar requirements for new construction advance these goals.

### What federal funding is available for climate resilience in Hawaii?

Hawaii received $3.8 million in FEMA BRIC funding in 2023. NOAA coastal resilience grants support beach and reef restoration. Army Corps erosion control projects address Waikiki and other vulnerable shorelines. IRA incentives are especially valuable given Hawaii's high electricity costs. Post-Maui wildfire federal engagement has expanded funding access statewide.
