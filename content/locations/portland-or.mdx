## Climate Snapshot

Portland sits at the confluence of the Willamette and Columbia Rivers, home to roughly 650,000 residents in the city proper and over 2.5 million across the metro area. The city's mild, wet winters and dry summers have historically made it one of the more temperate cities on the West Coast—but that reputation is shifting fast. Portland now contends with wildfire smoke, extreme heat events, and increasing flood risk driven by heavier precipitation and snowmelt patterns in the Cascades.

The June 2021 heat dome stands out as a defining climate event for the Pacific Northwest. Portland hit 116°F on June 28, 2021—shattering the previous all-time record by 8 degrees. Multnomah County recorded 69 heat-related deaths during that event. The September 2020 wildfire season blanketed the city in hazardous smoke for over a week, with AQI readings exceeding 500 and forcing thousands to shelter indoors. Property damage from the Labor Day fires across Oregon exceeded $1 billion.

Flooding remains a persistent concern. The Johnson Creek corridor and areas near the Columbia Slough experience regular flooding during atmospheric river events. The February 2020 floods caused over $5 million in damages to infrastructure in East Portland neighborhoods. Climate projections from Oregon State University indicate that the region will see 2-3x more days above 90°F by 2050 and a 10-20% increase in heavy precipitation events.

## Top Climate Risks

### Extreme Heat
Portland's built environment was not designed for sustained high temperatures. Only about 75% of residential units have air conditioning, and the urban heat island effect pushes temperatures in East Portland neighborhoods 10-15°F higher than in the tree-canopied west side. The 2021 heat dome caused road surfaces to buckle, streetcar cables to sag, and triggered rolling power outages. Multnomah County's Climate and Health Report projects heat-related hospitalizations could triple by 2040 without intervention.

### Wildfire Smoke
Western Oregon's wildfire seasons are lengthening by roughly two weeks per decade. The September 2020 smoke event kept Portland's air quality in the "hazardous" range for nine consecutive days. The economic cost of lost productivity and healthcare impacts during that event was estimated at $200 million for the metro area. Smoke intrusion events now occur in four out of every five summers, up from roughly one in five during the 1990s.

### Urban Flooding
Portland receives an average of 43 inches of rain annually, and aging stormwater infrastructure struggles to keep pace with increasingly intense precipitation. The city's combined sewer-stormwater system still serves about 30% of the urban core, leading to overflow events during heavy rain. The Bureau of Environmental Services has identified over $1.4 billion in needed stormwater infrastructure upgrades over the next 20 years.

## Local Climate Action

Portland adopted its first Carbon Reduction Strategy in 1993 and has since established itself as a national leader in climate planning. The 2015 Climate Action Plan set a target of 80% greenhouse gas reduction below 1990 levels by 2050. The updated 2023 Climate Emergency Workplan accelerated the timeline, calling for a 50% reduction by 2030 and net-zero by 2050.

Key initiatives include the Clean Energy Fund (Portland Clean Energy Community Benefits Fund), which generates approximately $60 million annually through a 1% surcharge on large retailers. These funds support weatherization, renewable energy installations, and green workforce training in frontline communities. The city's EcoDistricts program has piloted neighborhood-scale sustainability projects in the Lloyd District, South Waterfront, and Lents.

Portland's Urban Forestry division has committed to reaching 33% citywide canopy cover by 2035, up from the current 30%, with priority planting in East Portland's low-canopy areas.

## Regulations & Incentives

Oregon's statewide building code requires all new commercial buildings to meet net-zero-ready standards by 2029. Portland's own Green Building Policy mandates LEED Gold certification for all city-funded projects over $5 million. The city's Deconstruction Ordinance, in effect since 2017, requires homes built before 1940 to be deconstructed rather than demolished, diverting an estimated 6,000 tons of material from landfills annually.

The Portland Clean Energy Fund provides grants of $10,000-$100,000 for residential solar, weatherization, and heat pump installations, with priority for low-income households and communities of color. Oregon's Residential Energy Tax Credit offers up to $1,500 for heat pump installations. Energy Trust of Oregon provides additional rebates of $800-$3,000 for energy efficiency upgrades.

The Oregon Climate Protection Program, implemented in 2022, caps and reduces greenhouse gas emissions from fossil fuel suppliers, transportation fuels, and natural gas utilities, with a target of 90% reduction by 2050.

## Federal Funding Opportunities

The Inflation Reduction Act (IRA) makes Oregon residents eligible for up to $8,000 in heat pump rebates through the Home Efficiency Rebates program and up to $14,000 through the Home Electrification and Appliance Rebates (HEAR) program. Oregon's share of HEAR funding totals $113 million.

FEMA's Building Resilient Infrastructure and Communities (BRIC) program awarded Oregon $28.4 million in its 2023 cycle, including $9.2 million for wildfire mitigation projects in the Portland metro area. The Hazard Mitigation Grant Program (HMGP) provides additional post-disaster funding at 75% federal cost share.

The EPA's Climate Pollution Reduction Grants allocated $3 million in planning funds to the Portland metro area, with implementation grants of up to $4.6 billion available nationally. HUD's Community Development Block Grant—Disaster Recovery (CDBG-DR) program has provided Oregon with $422 million following the 2020 wildfire disasters.

## How Council Fire Can Help

Council Fire works with Pacific Northwest communities to translate climate risk into actionable resilience strategies. For Portland, that means helping city agencies and community organizations navigate the intersection of wildfire preparedness, heat adaptation, and stormwater management. Our team has experience developing grant applications for BRIC and IRA-funded programs, conducting vulnerability assessments for critical infrastructure, and building community engagement frameworks that center environmental justice.

Whether it's supporting the Portland Clean Energy Fund's implementation priorities, advising on green infrastructure design for flood-prone corridors, or developing climate adaptation plans for historically underinvested neighborhoods, Council Fire brings the technical expertise and strategic capacity to move projects from concept to completion.

## Frequently Asked Questions

### What are the biggest climate risks facing Portland?
Portland faces three primary climate threats: extreme heat events like the 2021 heat dome that killed 69 people in Multnomah County, wildfire smoke that now impacts the metro area most summers, and urban flooding from aging stormwater infrastructure overwhelmed by increasingly intense rainfall. East Portland neighborhoods bear disproportionate risk due to less tree canopy, more impervious surfaces, and older housing stock.

### Does Portland have a climate action plan?
Yes. Portland's 2023 Climate Emergency Workplan targets a 50% greenhouse gas reduction by 2030 and net-zero emissions by 2050. The city also operates the Portland Clean Energy Community Benefits Fund, which generates roughly $60 million per year for clean energy and resilience projects in frontline communities. Portland was one of the first U.S. cities to adopt a carbon reduction strategy, back in 1993.

### What federal funding is available for climate resilience in Oregon?
Oregon residents can access up to $14,000 in home electrification rebates through the IRA's HEAR program, with $113 million allocated to the state. FEMA's BRIC program awarded Oregon $28.4 million in 2023 for hazard mitigation. Additional funding is available through EPA Climate Pollution Reduction Grants, HUD CDBG-DR ($422 million for 2020 wildfire recovery), and USDA programs for rural and agricultural resilience.

### How does wildfire smoke affect Portland's public health?
Wildfire smoke exposure during the 2020 season resulted in a 25% increase in emergency room visits for respiratory complaints in the Portland metro area. Fine particulate matter (PM2.5) during severe smoke events exceeds WHO guidelines by 10-20x. Vulnerable populations—children, elderly residents, outdoor workers, and people with pre-existing respiratory conditions—face the greatest health risks. The city has designated cooling centers that double as clean air shelters during smoke events.
