## Climate Snapshot

Detroit, with a population of approximately 633,000, sits along the Detroit River connecting Lake St. Clair to Lake Erie. Once home to 1.8 million people, the city's population decline left behind an aging infrastructure system designed for a much larger population—including 2,700 miles of combined sewers that now serve one-third the intended users but still overflow catastrophically during storms. Detroit's flat terrain, clay-heavy soils, and impervious surfaces combine to create severe urban flooding during heavy rain events.

The June 2021 rainfall event was a turning point. Over 6 inches of rain fell in 12 hours across the metro area, overwhelming the Great Lakes Water Authority (GLWA) system and flooding an estimated 77,000 homes and businesses in Wayne County. FEMA declared a federal disaster, and damages exceeded $1 billion across the region. The same system flooded I-94, trapping hundreds of vehicles. This was not an isolated event—similar flooding occurred in August 2014, causing $1.8 billion in damages, making it one of the costliest inland flood events in U.S. history.

Detroit's climate is warming rapidly. Average winter temperatures have increased 4.5°F since 1970, while extreme heat days are climbing—the city recorded 22 days above 90°F in 2023, up from a historical average of 12. Lake Erie's warming waters are intensifying lake-effect precipitation and contributing to harmful algal blooms that threaten regional water supplies.

## Top Climate Risks

### Urban Flooding
Detroit's flat terrain, aging combined sewer system, and clay soils create some of the worst urban flood conditions in the Midwest. The 2014 and 2021 events together caused over $2.8 billion in damages. GLWA's system has capacity for approximately 1.7 inches of rainfall in a 24-hour period before overflows begin—a threshold exceeded increasingly often. Detroit has over 24,000 properties in flood-vulnerable areas, disproportionately concentrated in Black neighborhoods on the city's east side. Climate projections indicate a 25-35% increase in heavy precipitation events across the Great Lakes region by 2060.

### Extreme Heat
Detroit's heat vulnerability is amplified by social factors: 35% of residents live below the poverty line, many in older homes without air conditioning. A 2023 Wayne State University study found that historically redlined neighborhoods in Detroit experience summer temperatures 10-12°F higher than wealthier areas near the riverfront. Heat-related emergency department visits in Wayne County tripled between 2015 and 2023. The city's extensive vacant lot inventory (over 50,000 parcels) creates opportunities for green infrastructure but currently contributes to heat absorption.

### Great Lakes Ecosystem Stress
Rising lake temperatures, more intense precipitation, and urban runoff are degrading the Great Lakes ecosystem that Detroit depends on for drinking water. Lake Erie's harmful algal blooms, driven by nutrient runoff and warmer waters, have grown in frequency—the 2014 Toledo water crisis, caused by algal toxins just 50 miles south, demonstrated the vulnerability. Detroit's combined sewer overflows contribute an estimated 10 billion gallons of partially treated sewage to waterways annually, exacerbating water quality degradation.

## Local Climate Action

Detroit adopted its first comprehensive sustainability plan—Detroit Sustainability Action Agenda—in 2019, with an update in 2023 that established a target of 35% greenhouse gas reduction by 2030 and carbon neutrality by 2050. The city's Office of Sustainability coordinates implementation across departments.

Detroit's most impactful resilience initiative is its green stormwater infrastructure program. The city has installed over 100 green infrastructure projects since 2018, including the country's largest bioretention system at the Eliza Howell Park site, which manages stormwater from 680 acres. The Detroit Water and Sewerage Department (DWSD) offers a stormwater drainage charge credit of up to 90% for properties that manage stormwater on-site.

The city's Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy Ordinance (2022) requires new municipal buildings to be net-zero energy ready and existing municipal buildings over 10,000 square feet to reduce energy use 30% by 2030. Detroit Renewable Energy operates the city's waste-to-energy facility, though its future is under review due to air quality concerns in the surrounding 48217 ZIP code—Michigan's most polluted.

## Regulations & Incentives

Michigan's MI Healthy Climate Plan (2022) targets economy-wide carbon neutrality by 2050, with a 52% reduction by 2030. The state's Clean Energy Future package (2023) requires utilities to achieve 100% clean energy by 2040 and mandates energy waste reduction of 2% annually. DTE Energy, Detroit's primary utility, offers net metering, a $500 residential solar rebate, and a Voluntary Green Pricing program.

DWSD's stormwater credit program—offering up to 90% fee reduction—is one of the most generous in the nation and has driven significant private investment in green infrastructure. The Michigan Saves green lending program provides low-interest financing for residential and commercial energy improvements. Michigan's Property Assessed Clean Energy (PACE) program enables commercial buildings to finance resilience upgrades through property tax assessments.

Wayne County's Environmental Justice Action Plan (2023) directs 40% of climate investments to overburdened communities, aligning with federal Justice40 requirements.

## Federal Funding Opportunities

Michigan's IRA Home Energy Rebate allocation totals $218 million. Detroit residents can access up to $8,000 for heat pumps and $14,000 for income-qualified households. Federal 30% tax credits for solar, batteries, and efficiency improvements run through 2032.

FEMA's BRIC program awarded $22 million to Wayne County in 2022 for flood mitigation following the 2021 disaster, funding green infrastructure and drainage improvements in Detroit's most vulnerable neighborhoods. The $1 billion annual BRIC allocation continues to prioritize repetitive flood loss communities.

The EPA's Great Lakes Restoration Initiative (GLRI) provides approximately $350 million annually for Great Lakes protection, with Detroit eligible for stormwater and habitat restoration projects. The Bipartisan Infrastructure Law allocated $55 billion for water infrastructure nationally, and Michigan's Water Infrastructure Finance Authority has directed over $500 million to Detroit-area water and sewer improvements since 2022.

The DOE's Weatherization Assistance Program allocated $42 million to Michigan in 2023. HUD's Choice Neighborhoods program funded $35 million for the Corktown/North Corktown redevelopment, incorporating climate-resilient affordable housing.
