## Climate Snapshot

San Antonio, Texas is the seventh-largest city in the United States with a population of approximately 1.5 million and a metro area of 2.6 million. Located on the Balcones Escarpment where the Texas Hill Country meets the Gulf Coastal Plain, San Antonio's geography creates a collision zone for weather—Gulf moisture meets Hill Country terrain, producing some of the most intense flash flood events in North America. The city sits atop the Edwards Aquifer, one of the most productive and most vulnerable groundwater sources in the country.

San Antonio has long been called "Flash Flood Alley" and for good reason. In October 2024, a tropical moisture plume dropped 8 inches of rain in 5 hours across the northwest side, flooding 3,000 homes along Leon Creek and causing $120 million in damages. In May 2013, heavy rain killed 3 people and caused $50 million in damages along Salado Creek. The Flood of 1998 killed 31 people across south-central Texas, with $750 million in damages in the San Antonio metro. These events are becoming more frequent as climate change intensifies the moisture available for extreme rainfall.

San Antonio recorded 77 days above 100°F in 2023, obliterating the previous record of 59 set in 2011. The 2011 drought was the most severe in Texas recorded history, triggering Stage 4 water restrictions and pushing the Edwards Aquifer to its lowest level in decades. Water scarcity and extreme heat are existential threats for a city that continues to grow rapidly—Bexar County added 200,000 residents between 2015 and 2024.

## Top Climate Risks

### Extreme Heat and Drought
San Antonio's heat is among the most severe of any major U.S. city. The 77 days above 100°F in 2023 represented a 60% increase from the 2000-2020 average. Heat-related deaths in Bexar County reached 42 in 2023—the highest on record. The city's south and west sides, home to predominantly Hispanic and low-income communities, experience temperatures 10-14°F higher than the more affluent north side. Drought compounds heat risk: the 2011 drought reduced Edwards Aquifer levels to trigger Stage 4 restrictions, and climate projections indicate 30% less summer precipitation by 2060.

### Flash Flooding
San Antonio's position at the base of the Hill Country's thin-soiled limestone terrain creates flash flood conditions unmatched in most of the U.S. Rainfall on the rocky Hill Country runs off almost instantly into creeks that pass through San Antonio. The San Antonio River Authority (SARA) has identified over 9,000 structures in the 100-year floodplain within Bexar County. The city's $500 million flood control investment since 2000—including the San Pedro Creek Culture Park and Westside Creeks restoration—has reduced risk in targeted areas, but tributary flooding remains widespread. Climate models project 15-20% increases in extreme rainfall intensity.

### Water Supply Vulnerability
San Antonio was once the largest U.S. city dependent on a single water source—the Edwards Aquifer. The San Antonio Water System (SAWS) has diversified with the 142-mile Vista Ridge pipeline (operational 2020, 50,000 acre-feet annually) and brackish groundwater desalination, but the Edwards Aquifer still provides 40% of supply. Aquifer recharge depends heavily on rainfall patterns that are becoming more variable. SAWS projects a potential supply gap of 50,000 acre-feet by 2060 under drought conditions, even with planned projects.

## Local Climate Action

San Antonio adopted its SA Climate Ready plan in 2019, targeting carbon neutrality by 2050 with an interim 41% reduction by 2030 from a 2016 baseline. The plan was the first comprehensive climate plan for a major Texas city and was developed through extensive community engagement in both English and Spanish.

CPS Energy, San Antonio's municipally owned utility, announced its FlexPOWER Bundle in 2022—a $1 billion investment to add 900 MW of solar, 50 MW of battery storage, and close the J.K. Spruce coal plant by 2028. CPS Energy's clean energy portfolio reached 38% in 2024, up from 12% in 2018. The utility's Save for Tomorrow Energy Plan (STEP) is one of the nation's most successful utility demand-side management programs, saving 2,700 MW-equivalent since 2009.

SAWS operates one of the most aggressive water conservation programs in the country. San Antonio's per-capita water use has dropped from 225 gallons per day in 1982 to 117 gallons in 2023—a 48% reduction despite the population doubling. SAWS's recycled water system provides 35,000 acre-feet annually for non-potable uses.

## Regulations & Incentives

Texas lacks a state climate plan, but San Antonio's municipal ownership of CPS Energy gives the city direct control over energy policy. CPS Energy offers residential solar rebates ($2,500), battery storage rebates ($2,500), smart thermostat rebates ($85), and extensive efficiency programs through STEP.

SAWS's tiered water pricing strongly incentivizes conservation, with rates quadrupling for the highest usage tiers. The city's Unified Development Code (updated 2022) requires low-impact development techniques for new construction, including rainwater harvesting, permeable surfaces, and native landscaping. San Antonio's tree preservation ordinance is one of Texas's strongest, requiring 1:1 replacement of heritage trees removed during development.

SARA's stormwater fee credit program provides up to 40% reduction for properties with green infrastructure. Texas's property tax exemption for solar and wind covers 100% of added assessed value.

## Federal Funding Opportunities

Texas's IRA allocation of $587 million for Home Energy Rebates is the nation's largest. San Antonio residents can access up to $8,000 for heat pumps and $14,000 for income-qualified households. Federal 30% tax credits for solar, batteries, and efficiency improvements run through 2032.

FEMA BRIC awarded $16 million to Bexar County in 2023 for flood mitigation along Salado Creek and Leon Creek. The Army Corps of Engineers' San Antonio Channel Improvement Project has received $150 million in cumulative federal investment. FEMA's Flood Mitigation Assistance program funded $20 million in repetitive-loss acquisitions since 2019.

The Bureau of Reclamation's WaterSMART program provides grants for water conservation and recycling projects, with SAWS receiving $5 million for aquifer storage and recovery in 2023. DOE Weatherization allocated $65 million to Texas in 2023. EPA's Climate Pollution Reduction Grants provided the San Antonio region with planning funds
