## Climate Snapshot

Baltimore, Maryland's largest city with a population of approximately 570,000, occupies a sprawling footprint along the Patapsco River and the upper Chesapeake Bay. The city's port — the furthest inland on the East Coast — drives a regional economy worth over $3 billion annually. Its aging infrastructure, combined with significant socioeconomic disparities, makes Baltimore acutely vulnerable to compounding climate hazards.

The city has experienced a sharp increase in extreme weather events. In July 2023, a flash flood event dumped over 4 inches of rain in two hours on the Ellicott City corridor, causing $20 million in damages. Baltimore recorded its hottest summer on record in 2024, with 28 days exceeding 95°F. The urban heat island effect amplifies temperatures by 10–15°F in neighborhoods like Brooklyn-Curtis Bay and Cherry Hill compared to surrounding suburban areas.

Baltimore's Inner Harbor and Fells Point flood regularly during nor'easters and high-tide events. The Francis Scott Key Bridge collapse in March 2024, while not climate-related, exposed the fragility of critical port infrastructure and underscored the urgency of resilience investments across the city's transportation network.

## Top Climate Risks

### Extreme Heat

Baltimore's urban heat island is among the most severe on the East Coast. A 2019 NOAA/University of Maryland study found summer temperature differentials of up to 17°F between tree-lined neighborhoods in Roland Park and industrial areas in South Baltimore. Heat-related emergency room visits spike 25% during multi-day heat waves. The city experiences an average of 40 days above 90°F annually, projected to reach 70+ days by 2050 under RCP 8.5 scenarios.

### Inland & Coastal Flooding

Baltimore faces a dual flooding threat: coastal surge from the Chesapeake Bay and flash flooding from overwhelmed stormwater systems. The Jones Falls, Gwynns Falls, and Herring Run watersheds channel runoff through dense urban corridors with limited pervious surfaces. FEMA's National Risk Index ranks Baltimore in the 95th percentile for riverine flooding risk. Sea level at the Baltimore tide gauge has risen 12 inches since 1900, and NOAA projects an additional 1–3 feet by 2060.

### Aging Infrastructure

Baltimore's water and sewer systems date to the late 19th century. The city operates under a federal consent decree to address over 60 billion gallons of annual sewer overflows. Climate change intensifies this problem — a 1-inch rainstorm now generates roughly 30% more runoff than it did in 1980 due to impervious surface expansion and precipitation intensity increases.

## Local Climate Action

Baltimore's Climate Action Plan (2023 update, "Brandon Scott's Baltimore Climate Action Plan") targets carbon neutrality by 2045 and a 60% emissions reduction by 2030. Priority areas include building decarbonization, equitable transit, urban forestry, and climate-ready infrastructure. The plan explicitly centers environmental justice, recognizing that historically redlined neighborhoods bear disproportionate climate risk.

The city's Office of Sustainability administers the Baltimore Green Network, which converts vacant lots into managed green spaces — over 10,000 parcels to date. Baltimore's TreeBaltimore initiative aims to increase citywide tree canopy from 28% to 40% by 2037. The city also participates in the C40 Cities network, committing to Paris Agreement–aligned emissions targets.

Maryland's Climate Solutions Now Act (2022) requires net-zero statewide emissions by 2045 and mandates Building Performance Standards for large commercial buildings, directly affecting Baltimore's commercial real estate sector.

## Regulations & Incentives

Maryland's Building Performance Standards require buildings over 35,000 square feet to achieve net-zero direct emissions by 2040, with interim benchmarking starting in 2025. Baltimore's Stormwater Remediation Fee incentivizes green infrastructure through credits for on-site stormwater management. The city's Green Building Standards require LEED Silver or equivalent for city-funded projects.

The Maryland Energy Administration's Commercial Clean Energy Grant Program provides up to $250,000 per project. BGE's (Baltimore Gas & Electric) smart energy programs offer rebates for HVAC upgrades, insulation, and appliance replacements. The state's Solar Renewable Energy Credits (SRECs) provide ongoing revenue for solar installations.

Federal 179D tax deductions for energy-efficient commercial buildings and 30% Investment Tax Credits for solar and storage under the IRA are available statewide.

## Federal Funding Opportunities

Baltimore has been a major recipient of federal resilience funding. The city received $16 million in FEMA BRIC grants in 2023 for flood mitigation along the Jones Falls corridor. The Bipartisan Infrastructure Law allocates $55 billion nationally for water infrastructure, with Baltimore eligible for EPA State Revolving Fund loans to address its consent decree obligations.

The EPA's $3 billion Environmental and Climate Justice Block Grant program prioritizes communities with environmental justice concerns — Baltimore's Brooklyn-Curtis Bay and Westport neighborhoods qualify under multiple criteria. The IRA's $27 billion Greenhouse Gas Reduction Fund has already deployed capital to Maryland-based green banks.

HUD's Community Development Block Grants and the Department of Energy's Weatherization Assistance Program provide additional funding pathways. The Army Corps of Engineers' Baltimore District oversees several active flood risk management studies with federal cost-sharing potential.

## How Council Fire Can Help

Council Fire's work with the Maryland Port Administration — where our team identified $125 million in operational savings through sustainability-driven infrastructure planning — demonstrates the kind of impact we deliver for Baltimore's critical assets. The Port of Baltimore's post-Key Bridge recovery is an inflection point for embedding resilience into every phase of reconstruction and long-term capital planning.

Our Annapolis headquarters puts us 30 miles from Baltimore's City Hall, and our relationships with Maryland state agencies, NOAA's Chesapeake Bay Office, and the Army Corps' Baltimore District give us a head start on navigating the funding and regulatory landscape. Whether you're a port operator, commercial property owner facing building performance standards, or a community development corporation seeking environmental justice grants, Council Fire brings the technical credibility and grant strategy expertise to turn climate risk into competitive advantage.

## Frequently Asked Questions

### What are the biggest climate risks facing Baltimore?

Extreme urban heat, inland flooding from overwhelmed stormwater systems, and coastal flooding from Chesapeake Bay storm surge are Baltimore's top three climate risks. The city's aging infrastructure and environmental justice disparities amplify vulnerability — low-income neighborhoods experience summer temperatures 10–17°F higher than wealthier areas.

### Does Baltimore have a climate action plan?

Yes. Baltimore updated its Climate Action Plan in 2023 under Mayor Brandon Scott, targeting carbon neutrality by 2045 and 60% emissions reduction by 2030. The plan prioritizes building decarbonization, urban forestry, equitable transit, and environmental justice.

### What federal funding is available for climate resilience in Maryland?

Maryland communities can access FEMA BRIC grants, Bipartisan Infrastructure Law water infrastructure funding, EPA Environmental and Climate Justice Block Grants, IRA Greenhouse Gas Reduction Fund capital, Army Corps flood risk management programs, and HUD community development grants. Baltimore received $16 million in BRIC funding in 2023 alone.

### How does the urban heat island affect Baltimore residents?

Temperature differences of up to 17°F exist between Baltimore's coolest and hottest neighborhoods. Industrial and historically redlined areas with less tree canopy experience significantly more heat stress, leading to 25% spikes in heat-related ER visits during multi-day heat waves. The city's TreeBaltimore initiative aims to increase canopy cover from 28% to 40%.
