## Climate Snapshot

Texas is the nation's second-largest state by area (268,596 square miles) and second-most populous (30.5 million), with a $2.3 trillion economy that would rank as the eighth-largest in the world if independent. The state's climate risk profile is correspondingly massive: 367 miles of Gulf coastline, 254 counties spanning humid subtropical to semi-arid to desert climates, and infrastructure systems that have failed catastrophically under climate stress.

Winter Storm Uri (February 2021) killed an estimated 246 people and caused $195 billion in damage when the ERCOT electrical grid collapsed under extreme cold, leaving 4.5 million homes without power for days. Hurricane Harvey (2017) dumped 60 inches of rain on the Houston metro, causing $125 billion in damage—the costliest U.S. natural disaster after Hurricane Katrina. These events bookend Texas's dual climate vulnerability: the state faces both intensifying heat and drought and more destructive coastal storms and flooding.

Texas has warmed approximately 1.5°F since 1960, with West Texas warming faster. Annual precipitation patterns are shifting, with the eastern half receiving more intense rainfall events and the western half trending drier. The Gulf of Mexico's warming surface temperatures support stronger storms and more atmospheric moisture.

## Top Climate Risks

### Hurricane & Coastal Flooding

The Texas Gulf Coast has been struck by three Category 4+ hurricanes since 2017 (Harvey, Laura, and Beryl). Harvey's 60 inches of rainfall over four days produced the largest single-event rainfall in U.S. history. The Houston Ship Channel—handling 25% of U.S. petroleum refining—lacks comprehensive surge protection. The Port of Houston's economic throughput exceeds $800 billion annually, and a direct Category 4 hit could produce $100+ billion in damage and months of energy supply disruption.

### Extreme Heat & Grid Vulnerability

Texas averages 60–100 days above 90°F (varying by region), with projections of 80–140 days by 2050. Summer 2023 set records across the state, with multiple cities exceeding 110°F. The ERCOT grid—which operates independently of the national grid and serves 90% of Texas—has repeatedly faced emergency conditions during summer heat waves and winter storms. Peak demand exceeded 85 GW in summer 2023, approaching system limits.

### Drought & Water Scarcity

Texas faces a structural water deficit: the 2022 State Water Plan projects that by 2070, existing water supplies will meet only 57% of demand without new infrastructure. West Texas and the Panhandle are depleting the Ogallala Aquifer faster than it recharges. The 2011 drought—the worst single-year drought in Texas history—caused $8 billion in agricultural losses. Cities including San Antonio, El Paso, and Midland-Odessa face near-term supply constraints.

## Local Climate Action

Texas does not have a statewide climate action plan, and the Legislature has historically resisted climate-specific legislation. However, market forces and municipal action are driving significant change. Texas leads the nation in wind energy (over 40 GW installed capacity) and ranks second in solar (over 20 GW). The state's competitive electricity market has made renewables the cheapest new generation source.

Houston's Climate Action Plan (2020) targets carbon neutrality by 2050, with interim goals including 100% renewable municipal electricity by 2025 (achieved), 50% reduction in vehicle miles traveled by city fleet, and a resilience hub network in vulnerable communities.

San Antonio's Climate Ready SA plan targets carbon neutrality by 2050, supported by CPS Energy's FlexPOWER initiative (transitioning from coal to solar-plus-storage). Austin's Austin Climate Equity Plan targets net-zero community emissions by 2040.

The Texas Water Development Board's State Water Plan identifies $80 billion in needed water infrastructure investment through 2070.

## Regulations & Incentives

Texas does not adopt a statewide building code—adoption is local. Major cities (Houston, Dallas, San Antonio, Austin) generally enforce the International Building Code. Coastal cities enforce additional wind-speed provisions. Houston updated its flood regulations post-Harvey, requiring 2 feet of freeboard and detention for all new development.

TX-PACE financing is available statewide for commercial energy efficiency, water conservation, and resilience improvements. The state's Property Tax Code exempts the appraised value of solar and wind energy devices from property taxes. Texas's competitive retail electricity market allows consumers to choose 100% renewable electricity plans.

The Texas Commission on Environmental Quality (TCEQ) administers air quality, water quality, and waste management regulations. The Texas General Land Office manages coastal resilience and the Alamo Fund for coastal protection projects.

## Federal Funding Opportunities

FEMA has provided over $20 billion in disaster assistance to Texas since 2017, including $15 billion for Harvey alone. HMGP allocations from Harvey, Laura, and the Winter Storm Uri disaster declarations fund ongoing mitigation projects across the state.

The Army Corps of Engineers' Galveston District manages over $5 billion in active or planned Texas coastal projects, including the Coastal Texas Study ($34 billion Ike Dike), the Houston Ship Channel expansion, and Sabine Pass to Galveston Bay shoreline protection.

The Bureau of Reclamation and USDA provide significant water infrastructure and agricultural conservation funding relevant to Texas's western and agricultural regions.

The DOE's Industrial Decarbonization program, Hydrogen Hub initiative, and Carbon Capture programs are highly relevant to Texas's energy and petrochemical corridor, with potential investments in the tens of billions.

## How Council Fire Can Help

Council Fire's Texas practice spans the state's enormous climate risk landscape. On the Gulf Coast, we support municipalities, port authorities, and industrial clients with hurricane resilience, Army Corps coordination, and FEMA grant strategy. In Central and West Texas, we address water supply planning, drought adaptation, and grid resilience.

For energy and industrial clients, we provide climate risk assessment, regulatory compliance, and decarbonization roadmaps aligned with emerging federal and market requirements. Our municipal practice supports Texas cities with hazard mitigation planning, flood ordinance development, and resilience infrastructure design—bridging the gap left by limited state-level climate coordination.

## Frequently Asked Questions

### How reliable is the Texas power grid?

The ERCOT grid serves 90% of Texas and operates independently of the Eastern and Western interconnections, limiting the ability to import power during emergencies. Winter Storm Uri (2021) caused catastrophic grid failure, and summer 2023 saw multiple conservation appeals during heat waves. Post-Uri reforms include weatherization requirements for generators and gas facilities, increased reserve margins, and a new Performance Credit Mechanism to incentivize dispatchable capacity. Reliability has improved but remains a concern during extreme weather.

### What is the Ike Dike?

The Coastal Texas Protection and Restoration Study's coastal spine—nicknamed the "Ike Dike"—is a proposed $34 billion system of surge gates, levees, and nature-based features to protect Galveston Bay and the Houston Ship Channel from Gulf storm surge. Authorized in WRDA 2024, the project's centerpiece is a pair of surge gates at Bolivar Roads. Full construction would take 15–20 years. The project would protect $1 trillion+ in economic assets and critical energy infrastructure.

### How much water does Texas need?

The 2022 State Water Plan projects that by 2070, Texas will need 7.7 million acre-feet of additional water supply annually to meet demand. The plan identifies $80 billion in needed infrastructure, including reservoirs, desalination, aquifer storage, water reuse, and conservation. Without this investment, the plan estimates $153 billion in annual economic losses and 1.4 million lost jobs during drought. The Texas Water Development Board administers financing programs including the State Water Implementation Fund for Texas (SWIFT).

### Is Texas transitioning to clean energy?

Market forces are driving rapid clean energy adoption in Texas despite limited state policy support. The state leads the nation in wind generation (40+ GW) and ranks second in solar (20+ GW). In 2023, wind and solar generated over 30% of ERCOT's electricity. Battery storage deployment is accelerating (8+ GW installed or under construction). Texas's competitive electricity market, abundant wind and solar resources, and low permitting barriers make it the nation's largest clean energy market by deployment volume, even without a renewable portfolio standard.
