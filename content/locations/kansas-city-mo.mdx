## Climate Snapshot

Kansas City straddles the Missouri-Kansas border at the confluence of the Missouri and Kansas Rivers, with a city population of approximately 508,000 and a metro area of 2.2 million. The city's river-bottom geography and position in the central Great Plains expose it to an extraordinary range of climate hazards—from catastrophic river flooding to extreme heat, tornadoes, and ice storms. Kansas City's topography features dramatic elevation changes from the river bottoms to surrounding bluffs, creating both flood risk in low areas and landslide vulnerability on steep slopes.

The devastating floods of 1951 and 1993 remain defining events, but recent years have brought new challenges. In 2019, the Missouri River crested 16 feet above flood stage, causing $1 billion in damages across the region and closing I-29 for months. In August 2022, a flash flood event dropped 7 inches of rain in 4 hours on the south side, flooding 2,500 homes along Brush Creek and the Blue River. Damages in Jackson County exceeded $80 million. The Blue River, which runs through some of Kansas City's lowest-income neighborhoods, has been the metro's most flood-damaged waterway, with over $400 million in cumulative damages since 2000.

Kansas City recorded 60 days above 90°F in 2023 and 12 days above 100°F—well above historical averages of 40 and 5, respectively. The city's massive surface area (319 square miles) and car-dependent development pattern create extensive heat islands across commercial and industrial corridors.

## Top Climate Risks

### Flooding—River and Flash
Kansas City faces dual flood risk: major river flooding from the Missouri and Kansas Rivers, and flash flooding from urban creeks. The Blue River corridor, running through the city's east side, floods repeatedly during heavy rain events. The Army Corps of Engineers' Swope Park Industrial District levee protects critical infrastructure, but unleveed sections remain exposed. The city's stormwater system, managed by KC Water, struggles during intense rainfall—climate projections indicate a 20-30% increase in extreme precipitation events by 2060. KC Water's Overflow Control Plan requires $4.5 billion in investments over 25 years to address combined sewer overflows and reduce flood risk.

### Extreme Heat
Kansas City's continental location produces some of the Midwest's most extreme heat. The July 1980 heat wave killed 86 people in the metro area. In 2023, the city spent 12 days above 100°F, with heat index values exceeding 115°F on 4 days. A 2022 UMKC study found that predominantly Black neighborhoods on the east side experience temperatures 11°F higher than the Country Club Plaza area. Only 65% of rental units in KCMO have central air conditioning. Heat-related emergency calls increased 55% between 2018 and 2023.

### Tornadoes and Severe Storms
Kansas City sits at the eastern edge of Tornado Alley. The May 2003 tornado outbreak produced multiple tornadoes in the metro area, causing $130 million in damages. In May 2019, an EF-4 tornado struck Linwood, Kansas—a suburb—causing $2 billion in damages across the region. Severe thunderstorm events have intensified, with the June 2023 derecho producing sustained 80 mph winds across the metro and causing $150 million in damages. Winter ice storms also cause significant disruptions, with the January 2002 event causing $90 million in damages.

## Local Climate Action

Kansas City adopted its Climate Protection Plan in 2008, one of the earliest among major U.S. cities, and updated it as the KC Spirit Playbook in 2021 with a target of carbon neutrality by 2040—one of the most aggressive targets among Midwest cities. The plan targets 100% clean electricity by 2030 for city operations and 100% for the community by 2035.

KC Water's Overflow Control Plan is the city's largest infrastructure program, investing $4.5 billion over 25 years to address CSOs and improve stormwater management. The plan includes $400 million in green infrastructure investments, with over 200 projects completed since 2018 including bioretention in the 18th & Vine historic district and permeable pavement in the River Market area.

The city's Green KC initiative coordinates sustainability programs including a solar incentive program providing $0.25/watt rebates on residential installations, a residential rain garden grant program ($2,000 per household), and the KC Streetcar expansion (funded at $350 million) that will reduce transportation emissions along the city's main corridor.

## Regulations & Incentives

Missouri lacks a state climate plan, but Evergy (formerly KCP&L), Kansas City's primary utility, has committed to net-zero carbon by 2045. Evergy offers net metering, a community solar program, and demand response incentives. Missouri's solar property tax exemption removes 100% of added value from assessments for 25 years.

KC Water's stormwater fee credit program offers up to 50% reduction for green infrastructure installations. The city's PACE program finances commercial clean energy and resilience improvements. Kansas City's Green Building Resolution (2016) requires all new city-funded construction to achieve LEED Silver or equivalent.

The Mid-America Regional Council (MARC) coordinates regional climate planning and administers weatherization and energy efficiency programs serving the bi-state metro area. MARC's Climate Action KC coalition includes 35 jurisdictions and institutions working on collaborative emissions reduction.

## Federal Funding Opportunities

Missouri's IRA Home Energy Rebate allocation is $127 million, and Kansas (for the metro's Kansas-side communities) receives $55 million. Kansas City residents can access up to $8,000 for heat pumps and $14,000 for low-income households. Federal 30% tax credits for solar, batteries, and efficiency improvements run through 2032.

FEMA BRIC awarded $15 million to Jackson County in 2023 for Blue River flood mitigation. The Army Corps of Engineers' Kansas City Levee Improvement Program has received $200 million in Bipartisan Infrastructure Law funding for levee rehabilitation along the Missouri River. FEMA's Flood Mitigation Assistance program has funded $30 million in repetitive-loss buyouts along the Blue River since 2018.

EPA WIFIA provided $250 million in low-interest financing for KC Water's Overflow Control Plan. DOE Weatherization allocated $22 million to Missouri in 2023. DOT's Capital Investment Grant program provides $350 million for the KC Streetcar Main Street Extension.

## Frequently Asked Questions

### What are the biggest climate risks facing Kansas City?
Kansas City faces dual flooding risk (major river flooding from the Missouri/Kansas Rivers and flash flooding along the Blue River, with $400 million in cumulative Blue River damages since 2000), extreme heat (60 days above 90°F and 12 above 100°F in 2023, with 11°F disparities between neighborhoods), and severe storms including tornadoes. The May 2019 EF-4 tornado caused $2 billion in regional damages.

### Does Kansas City have a climate action plan?
Yes. Kansas City's KC Spirit Playbook targets carbon neutrality by 2040—one of the most aggressive timelines among Midwest cities. Key programs include KC Water's $4.5 billion Overflow Control Plan ($400 million for green infrastructure), the $350 million KC Streetcar expansion, residential solar rebates, and rain garden grants. The plan targets 100% clean electricity community-wide by 2035.

### What federal funding is available for climate resilience in Missouri?
Missouri communities can access $127 million in IRA Home Energy Rebates, FEMA BRIC grants ($15 million to Jackson County in 2023), Army Corps levee funding ($200 million from the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law), EPA WIFIA loans ($250 million for KC Water), and DOT Capital Investment Grants ($350 million for KC Streetcar). Federal 30% tax credits for solar and batteries run through 2032.

### How does Blue River flooding affect Kansas City?
The Blue River, running through Kansas City's east side, is the metro's most flood-damaged waterway, with over $400 million in cumulative damages since 2000. The corridor passes through predominantly low-income and minority neighborhoods with limited flood protection. FEMA has funded $30 million in property buyouts since 2018, and the 2023 BRIC award adds $15 million for mitigation. Despite investments, the Blue River remains a major risk as extreme rainfall intensifies.
