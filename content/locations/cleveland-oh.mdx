## Climate Snapshot

Cleveland, Ohio, population approximately 368,000, occupies a narrow coastal plain along Lake Erie's southern shore at the mouth of the Cuyahoga River. The city's geography—low-lying lakefront areas, steep bluffs along the lakeshore, and the deeply incised Cuyahoga valley—creates a concentrated set of climate vulnerabilities. Cleveland's combined sewer system, built in the early 20th century for a population three times its current size, remains the city's most persistent infrastructure liability.

In July 2022, a storm dropped 3.5 inches of rain in 90 minutes across Cleveland's east side, flooding over 2,000 basements and overwhelming the Northeast Ohio Regional Sewer District (NEORSD) system. Damages exceeded $30 million. Lake Erie's record-high water levels in 2019 and 2020 caused $12 million in shoreline erosion and infrastructure damage along the lakefront, including at Edgewater Park and the Cleveland Metroparks. In February 2023, a winter storm combined lake-effect snow with rapid warming, triggering ice jams on the Cuyahoga River that flooded the Flats district.

Cleveland is warming faster than national averages. Annual temperatures have increased 3.2°F since 1970, and the city recorded 25 days above 90°F in 2023—nearly triple the 1980-2000 average of 9 days. The warming trend is reducing Lake Erie ice cover, which in turn intensifies lake-effect precipitation and shoreline erosion.

## Top Climate Risks

### Urban Flooding and Combined Sewer Overflows
NEORSD's system discharges approximately 4.5 billion gallons of combined sewage annually during wet weather events. The district's EPA consent decree, Project Clean Lake, requires $3 billion in infrastructure investments through 2036. Cleveland has over 6,000 properties at risk of basement flooding during moderate rain events. The city's flat terrain in the east side and near-lakefront neighborhoods prevents natural drainage, and aging storm sewers frequently back up. Climate projections indicate a 15-20% increase in heavy precipitation events by 2050.

### Lake Erie Shoreline Erosion and Water Levels
Lake Erie's water levels have become increasingly volatile, swinging from record lows in 2012 to record highs in 2019-2020. The high-water period caused $30 million in damages along Cuyahoga County's 30-mile shoreline, eroding bluffs, damaging seawalls, and threatening the Shoreway (Route 2). Lake water temperatures have increased 7°F since 1995, reducing winter ice cover by 40% and intensifying wave energy that drives erosion. Warmer lake temperatures also fuel harmful algal blooms, threatening Cleveland's water intake in Lake Erie.

### Extreme Heat
Cleveland's heat exposure is rising steeply in a city unaccustomed to extended hot weather. Only 65% of Cleveland households have central air conditioning, compared to 90%+ in Sunbelt cities. A 2022 Cuyahoga County Board of Health study found that heat-related ER visits increased 80% between 2015 and 2022. The city's east side neighborhoods—predominantly Black and low-income—experience temperatures 8-10°F higher than lakefront areas due to less tree canopy and more impervious surfaces.

## Local Climate Action

Cleveland adopted its Climate Action Plan in 2018, updated in 2023 as Cleveland Climate Action Plan 2.0. The plan targets an 80% reduction in greenhouse gas emissions by 2050 from a 2010 baseline, with an interim 40% reduction by 2030. As of 2023, the city had achieved approximately 25% reduction, driven largely by the greening of the regional electricity grid.

Cleveland's Municipal Operations Sustainability Plan commits to 100% renewable electricity for city buildings by 2030 and fleet electrification of 50% by 2035. The city launched the Cleveland Tree Plan in 2022, targeting a 30% canopy increase by 2040 through planting 10,000 trees annually, with priority in heat-vulnerable neighborhoods.

The Cleveland Water Alliance, a public-private partnership, coordinates water innovation and resilience across the Lake Erie basin, positioning Cleveland as a hub for water technology. The city's Thriving Communities program integrates climate resilience into neighborhood revitalization, converting vacant lots into green infrastructure.

## Regulations & Incentives

Ohio lacks a comprehensive climate action plan at the state level, but the state's Energy Efficiency Resource Standard (frozen in 2019) still influences utility programs. Cleveland Public Power, the municipal utility, offers a green pricing option and net metering. FirstEnergy's Ohio Edison subsidiary provides energy efficiency rebates and demand response programs.

NEORSD's stormwater fee credit program offers up to 75% reduction for properties installing green infrastructure. The district's Project Clean Lake includes a green infrastructure component targeting 44 million gallons of CSO reduction through nature-based solutions. Cleveland's building code incorporates the 2021 IECC, and the city's Commercial Building Energy Performance Ordinance (proposed 2024) would require benchmarking for large commercial buildings.

The Cuyahoga County Green Building Program provides grants of up to $25,000 for residential green building improvements. Ohio's PACE enabling legislation allows commercial property owners to finance energy and resilience improvements through property assessments.

## Federal Funding Opportunities

Ohio's IRA Home Energy Rebate allocation totals $238 million. Cleveland residents can access up to $8,000 for heat pump installations and $14,000 for income-qualified households. Federal 30% tax credits for solar, batteries, and efficiency improvements are available through 2032.

FEMA BRIC awarded $12 million to Cuyahoga County in 2023 for flood mitigation, including green infrastructure along Doan Brook and Dugway Brook. The EPA's Great Lakes Restoration Initiative provides $350 million annually, with Cleveland-area projects receiving $8-12 million per year for habitat restoration, stormwater management, and Cuyahoga River remediation.

The Bipartisan Infrastructure Law's $55 billion water infrastructure allocation supports NEORSD's Project Clean Lake, with Ohio receiving over $1 billion in State Revolving Fund allocations. DOE's Weatherization Assistance Program allocated $55 million to Ohio in 2023. HUD's Choice Neighborhoods program has invested in the Opportunity Corridor neighborhood, integrating climate-resilient design into affordable housing.

## Frequently Asked Questions

### What are the biggest climate risks facing Cleveland?
Cleveland faces urban flooding and combined sewer overflows (4.5 billion gallons of CSO annually, requiring $3 billion in mandated infrastructure improvements), Lake Erie shoreline erosion and volatile water levels ($30 million in damages during 2019-2020 high-water period), and rising extreme heat (25 days above 90°F in 2023, nearly triple the historical average, with only 65% of households having central AC).

### Does Cleveland have a climate action plan?
Yes. Cleveland's Climate Action Plan 2.0 (2023) targets an 80% emissions reduction by 2050 and 40% by 2030. Key programs include the Cleveland Tree Plan (10,000 trees annually), Project Clean Lake ($3 billion in sewer infrastructure), 100% renewable electricity for city buildings by 2030, and the Thriving Communities vacant lot greening program. The city had achieved 25% emissions reduction as of 2023.

### What federal funding is available for climate resilience in Ohio?
Ohio communities can access $238 million in IRA Home Energy Rebates, FEMA BRIC grants ($12 million to Cuyahoga County in 2023), EPA Great Lakes Restoration Initiative funds ($350 million annually), Bipartisan Infrastructure Law water funding, and DOE Weatherization ($55 million for Ohio in 2023). The 30% federal tax credit for solar and battery storage runs through 2032.

### How does Lake Erie affect Cleveland's climate risks?
Lake Erie's warming waters (7°F increase since 1995) reduce winter ice cover by 40%, intensifying lake-effect precipitation and shoreline erosion. Volatile water levels caused $30 million in shoreline damage during the 2019-2020 high-water period. Warmer temperatures fuel harmful algal blooms that threaten Cleveland's drinking water supply. The lake also moderates summer heat in lakefront areas, creating a stark 8-10°F temperature gap with inland east side neighborhoods.
