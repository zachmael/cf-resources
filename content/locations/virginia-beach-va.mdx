## Climate Snapshot

Virginia Beach is the most populous city in Virginia (460,000 residents) and one of the most flood-prone metros on the East Coast. The city spans 497 square miles of low-lying coastal plain between the Chesapeake Bay, the Atlantic Ocean, and the Back Bay-North Landing River watershed. Its highest point is just 30 feet above sea level, and vast swaths of the city sit below 10 feet.

The Hampton Roads region is experiencing some of the fastest relative sea level rise on the Atlantic coast—approximately 18 inches over the past century at the Sewells Point tide gauge. This rate combines global sea level rise, regional ocean dynamics, and land subsidence from glacial isostatic adjustment and groundwater withdrawal. NOAA's intermediate projection estimates an additional 1.5 to 3 feet by 2060.

Recurrent tidal flooding has become a defining challenge. The city experiences over 15 tidal flood events per year—triple the frequency of the 1990s. The Chic's Beach, Shore Drive, and Sandbridge communities flood routinely during nor'easters and king tides, damaging homes, closing roads, and disrupting Naval Air Station Oceana operations.

## Top Climate Risks

### Sea Level Rise & Recurrent Flooding

Virginia Beach recorded 22 tidal flood events at the Sewell's Point gauge in 2023, up from an average of 5 per year in the 1990s. VIMS (Virginia Institute of Marine Science) projects 40–60 tidal flood days per year by 2050 under intermediate sea level rise. The city's stormwater system relies on gravity drainage to tidal waterways; as sea levels rise, outfall capacity diminishes, causing backups even during moderate rain.

### Nor'easters & Tropical Storms

Virginia Beach's oceanfront and Bay-side communities face repeated damage from nor'easters, which occur 10–15 times per year and can produce sustained winds of 50–70 mph and surge of 3–6 feet in the Chesapeake Bay. Hurricane-force events are less frequent but devastating—the 2003 Hurricane Isabel pushed 8 feet of surge into the Bay, flooding the entire Shore Drive corridor. A Category 2 or greater hurricane on a westward Bay track could push 10–15 feet of surge into densely developed areas.

### Military Installation Vulnerability

Naval Air Station Oceana and Joint Expeditionary Base Little Creek–Fort Story, both within Virginia Beach, face direct climate exposure. DOD's 2023 Climate Assessment identified both installations as high-risk for sea level rise and flooding. Encroachment of floodwaters threatens runways, housing, and critical support facilities. The city's economic dependence on military spending (over $10 billion annually in Hampton Roads) makes installation resilience a community-wide priority.

## Local Climate Action

Virginia Beach adopted its Sea Level Rise and Recurrent Flooding Policy in 2020, requiring all capital projects to incorporate 1.5 feet of sea level rise for a 2050 planning horizon and 3 feet for a 2080 horizon. The city's Comprehensive Sea Level Rise and Recurrent Flooding Study (2023) identified $3 billion in infrastructure needs across stormwater, transportation, and utilities.

The city's stormwater master plan targets $500 million in improvements over 20 years, funded through a dedicated stormwater enterprise fund. Priority projects include the Rudee Inlet pump station, Shore Drive tide gates, and green infrastructure installations across the Lynnhaven watershed.

Virginia Beach joined the Hampton Roads Regional Climate Adaptation Program, coordinated through HRPDC, which facilitates shared data, coordinated planning, and joint federal advocacy across 17 localities.

## Regulations & Incentives

Virginia's Flood Risk Management Standard (Executive Order 71) requires state-funded projects to account for sea level rise and increased precipitation. Virginia Beach's local ordinance requires 3 feet of freeboard above BFE for residential structures and 4 feet for critical facilities—among the most protective standards in the Southeast.

The Virginia Clean Economy Act (2020) mandates Dominion Energy reach 100% carbon-free electricity by 2045, with interim renewable targets driving utility-scale solar and offshore wind development. Virginia Beach sits adjacent to the Coastal Virginia Offshore Wind project (2.6 GW), the nation's largest offshore wind project under construction.

Virginia's solar property tax exemption and Dominion's net metering program support residential and commercial solar adoption. The state's PACE-enabling legislation allows localities to establish commercial PACE programs.

## Federal Funding Opportunities

The Army Corps of Engineers' Norfolk District is conducting the City of Virginia Beach Coastal Storm Risk Management Feasibility Study, evaluating structural and nature-based alternatives for the oceanfront, Shore Drive, and southern watersheds. The study could support a federal project in the $500 million–$1 billion range.

FEMA BRIC and FMA programs are active funding sources. Virginia Beach has received over $25 million in FEMA mitigation grants since 2018 for stormwater improvements and property acquisition.

DOD's REPI (Readiness and Environmental Protection Integration) program funds land conservation buffers around military installations, and the Defense Community Infrastructure Program provides grants for community resilience projects near bases. Both programs are highly relevant to Virginia Beach.

The Bipartisan Infrastructure Law allocated $50 billion for climate resilience across federal agencies, with programs administered through EPA, DOT, and NOAA all applicable to Virginia Beach's infrastructure needs.

## How Council Fire Can Help

Council Fire's Hampton Roads practice supports Virginia Beach and neighboring communities with sea level rise planning, stormwater infrastructure design, and federal resilience funding strategy. We bring direct experience with Army Corps feasibility studies, FEMA BRIC applications, and DOD-community resilience partnerships.

Our sustainability consulting practice helps developers navigate Virginia Beach's evolving freeboard and sea level rise requirements, secure green building certifications, and capitalize on the emerging offshore wind supply chain. For military-connected clients, we provide installation resilience assessments and REPI/DCIP grant strategy.

## Frequently Asked Questions

### Why is sea level rising faster in Virginia Beach than the global average?

Hampton Roads experiences roughly twice the global average rate of sea level rise due to land subsidence. The region is slowly sinking as part of a geological process called glacial isostatic adjustment—the land that was pushed up when ice sheets weighed down areas to the north is now settling back down. Historical groundwater withdrawal has added to subsidence. Combined, these factors produce relative sea level rise of approximately 5 mm per year at Sewells Point.

### How will offshore wind affect Virginia Beach?

The Coastal Virginia Offshore Wind project (2.6 GW, 176 turbines) is being constructed approximately 27 miles off Virginia Beach's coast. When operational (expected 2027), it will power roughly 660,000 homes. The project is creating supply chain and port jobs in Hampton Roads. Dominion Energy's lease area could eventually support up to 6 GW of capacity. Environmental monitoring is tracking potential impacts on marine life, fishing, and viewshed.

### What should Virginia Beach homeowners do to prepare for flooding?

Priority actions include: obtaining an elevation certificate, reviewing flood insurance coverage (many properties outside mapped flood zones still flood), elevating HVAC and electrical systems, installing backflow preventers on sewer lines, and maintaining natural drainage features on your property. The city's stormwater management office provides free consultations and maintains an online flood risk viewer. For properties with repeated flooding, voluntary buyout and elevation programs may be available through FEMA.
