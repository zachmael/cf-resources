## Climate Snapshot

Maryland straddles the Chesapeake Bay—the nation's largest estuary—with 3,190 miles of tidal shoreline making it one of the most water-exposed states in the country. From the barrier islands of Ocean City on the Atlantic to the Appalachian ridges of Western Maryland, the state contains an extraordinary range of climate vulnerabilities concentrated in a small geographic footprint (12,407 square miles).

The state has warmed approximately 2°F since the 1960s, with the Eastern Shore and Baltimore metro warming slightly faster than the western mountains. Sea level in the Chesapeake Bay has risen 12–14 inches over the past century at the Annapolis and Baltimore tide gauges, with the rate accelerating. Maryland's Commission on Climate Change projects 2.1 feet of sea level rise by 2050 under the high scenario—a planning benchmark the state adopted in 2023.

Maryland's population of 6.2 million is concentrated in the Baltimore-Washington corridor, but climate impacts reach every county. The Eastern Shore faces chronic tidal flooding and agricultural disruption. Baltimore confronts urban heat and stormwater flooding. Annapolis—the state capital—is among the most tide-flooded cities in the nation. Western Maryland deals with flash flooding, severe storms, and shifting agricultural zones.

## Top Climate Risks

### Sea Level Rise & Chesapeake Bay Flooding

Annapolis already experiences over 50 tidal flood events per year at the City Dock—a 400% increase from the 1990s. The Eastern Shore's low-lying communities (Cambridge, Crisfield, Smith Island) face existential flooding threats. Dorchester County alone has lost over 7,000 acres to inundation and erosion since 1850. NOAA projects that at 2 feet of additional sea level rise, over 250,000 acres of Maryland's coastal zone would be below the high-tide line.

### Extreme Heat & Urban Heat Islands

Baltimore's urban heat island produces temperatures 10–15°F higher than surrounding suburbs during heat waves. The city averages 40 days per year above 90°F, projected to reach 60–80 days by 2050. Heat is already Maryland's deadliest weather hazard—Baltimore experienced 76 heat-related deaths between 2013 and 2022. Environmental justice communities in East and West Baltimore, with less tree canopy, more impervious surface, and older housing, bear disproportionate exposure.

### Intensifying Precipitation & Flash Flooding

Maryland has experienced a 55% increase in heavy precipitation events since the 1950s—the largest increase of any Mid-Atlantic state. Ellicott City's catastrophic flash floods in 2016 and 2018 killed two people and caused over $300 million in damage. Howard County subsequently invested $140 million in the Ellicott City Safe Harbor plan, including a diversion tunnel, dam, and channel improvements. Aging stormwater infrastructure in Baltimore and Prince George's County regularly fails during intense rainfall.

## Local Climate Action

Maryland's Climate Solutions Now Act (2022) is among the nation's most ambitious state climate laws, requiring 60% greenhouse gas reduction by 2031 (from 2006 levels) and net-zero by 2045. The Act mandates building performance standards for large commercial buildings, electrification-ready building codes, and a comprehensive environmental justice framework.

The Maryland Commission on Climate Change provides policy recommendations and oversees the state's adaptation planning. The 2024 update to the state's Greenhouse Gas Reduction Act Plan identifies over 100 implementation actions across energy, transportation, buildings, and land use.

Baltimore's Climate Action Plan targets 60% emissions reduction by 2030 and carbon neutrality by 2045. The city is installing 1,000+ urban trees annually, upgrading stormwater infrastructure, and implementing building energy performance standards.

## Regulations & Incentives

Maryland's Building Performance Standards (part of Climate Solutions Now Act) require large commercial buildings (>25,000 sq ft) to achieve net-zero direct emissions by 2040, with interim benchmarks starting in 2025. The state's updated building code requires EV-ready wiring in new construction and solar-ready roof design.

The Maryland Energy Administration offers commercial and residential incentives including solar grants ($1,000 for residential systems), EV charging infrastructure grants, geothermal tax credits, and the EmPOWER Maryland energy efficiency programs administered through utilities. BGE, Pepco, and Potomac Edison collectively invest over $200 million annually in ratepayer-funded efficiency programs.

Maryland's Coastal Resilience Program (CoastSmart) provides grants and technical assistance for local government climate adaptation, including sea level rise planning, green infrastructure, and floodplain management. The state's Living Shoreline Protection Act requires living shorelines as the default erosion control method (over hardened structures) for tidal shoreline projects.

## Federal Funding Opportunities

The Chesapeake Bay Program—a federal-state partnership with over $90 million in annual EPA funding—supports water quality, habitat restoration, and climate adaptation across the 64,000-square-mile watershed. Maryland receives significant funding for agricultural best management practices, stormwater retrofits, and wetland restoration.

FEMA BRIC and FMA programs have funded over $50 million in Maryland mitigation projects since 2020, including Ellicott City flood improvements, Eastern Shore property acquisition, and Baltimore stormwater upgrades.

The Army Corps' Baltimore District manages multiple coastal and flood risk studies, including the Baltimore Metropolitan Water Resources Study and shoreline protection projects for Chesapeake Bay communities.

The Inflation Reduction Act's CPRG program, EPA Environmental Justice grants, and DOE energy efficiency formula funding all provide significant resources for Maryland's climate action agenda.

## How Council Fire Can Help

Council Fire supports Maryland clients across the state's diverse climate risk landscape. We work with Chesapeake Bay communities on sea level rise planning, living shoreline design, and CoastSmart program implementation. In Baltimore and the metro corridor, we support building performance standard compliance, stormwater master planning, and environmental justice-centered resilience initiatives.

Our federal funding practice helps Maryland municipalities and counties navigate the complex landscape of Chesapeake Bay Program, FEMA, Army Corps, and IRA-funded programs. For commercial real estate clients, we provide climate risk assessment, building decarbonization roadmaps, and compliance strategy for the state's building performance standards.

## Frequently Asked Questions

### How much will sea level rise in Maryland?

Maryland's Commission on Climate Change adopted a planning projection of 2.1 feet of sea level rise by 2050 (high scenario) for state-funded projects. The full range of projections spans 0.8 to 3.4 feet by 2050 and 1.6 to 6.3 feet by 2100, depending on emissions trajectory and ice sheet dynamics. The Annapolis and Baltimore tide gauges show accelerating trends consistent with the higher end of projections.

### What is the Climate Solutions Now Act?

Signed in 2022, the Climate Solutions Now Act is Maryland's landmark climate legislation. It requires 60% greenhouse gas reduction by 2031 and net-zero by 2045, mandates building performance standards for large buildings, establishes environmental justice requirements for state agencies, requires electrification-ready building codes, and creates the Just Green Jobs initiative. It represents one of the most aggressive state-level climate policy frameworks in the nation.

### How does Maryland protect the Chesapeake Bay from climate change?

Maryland's Chesapeake Bay protection strategy combines nutrient pollution reduction, habitat restoration, and climate adaptation. The state's Watershed Implementation Plan commits to reducing nitrogen, phosphorus, and sediment loads to meet EPA-established Bay Total Maximum Daily Load (TMDL) targets by 2025. Climate adaptation measures include living shoreline requirements, coastal resilience grants, and integration of sea level rise projections into all state-funded Bay restoration projects.

### What assistance is available for flood-prone properties in Maryland?

Maryland offers multiple programs: FEMA HMGP and FMA for property acquisition, elevation, and flood-proofing; the state's Nuisance Flood Relief Fund for chronically flooded areas; CoastSmart grants for local government flood mitigation; and the Maryland Department of Housing's weatherization and home rehabilitation programs. The state's FloodAware tool provides property-specific flood risk information to help residents and businesses make informed decisions.
