## Climate Snapshot

Seattle, home to approximately 750,000 residents across 84 square miles, occupies a narrow isthmus between Puget Sound and Lake Washington. The city's hilly terrain, marine climate, and dense urban core create a distinct set of climate vulnerabilities that differ from Sun Belt or Atlantic Coast cities but are no less serious.

The Pacific Northwest heat dome of June 2021 shattered every assumption about Seattle's climate. Temperatures hit 108°F on June 28—41 degrees above the historical June average and a record that seemed physically impossible for the region. The three-day event killed over 600 people across the Pacific Northwest, including 134 in Washington state. Seattle's building stock, largely designed without air conditioning, became a death trap for elderly and vulnerable residents. Only 44% of Seattle households had AC at the time.

Wildfire smoke has become a recurring seasonal hazard. The 2020 fire season pushed Seattle's AQI above 300 for multiple days. The 2024 season brought 18 days of unhealthy air quality from fires in British Columbia and Eastern Washington. Meanwhile, atmospheric rivers deliver increasingly intense precipitation—the November 2021 event dropped 5 inches in 24 hours on saturated soils, triggering landslides across the city's steep slopes.

## Top Climate Risks

### Extreme Heat and Heat Vulnerability

The 2021 heat dome was a preview. Climate models project Seattle will experience 10–20 days above 90°F by 2050, up from a historical average of 3. The city's older housing stock—over 60% of units built before 1980—lacks mechanical cooling and adequate insulation. Neighborhoods with the least tree canopy, including parts of Rainier Valley, South Park, and Georgetown, experience surface temperatures 10–15°F above tree-lined areas like Capitol Hill.

### Landslides and Flooding

Seattle has over 1,000 mapped landslide-prone slopes. Heavy rainfall saturates the glacial till that underlies the city's hills, triggering slides that damage homes, block roads, and rupture utilities. The city averages 15–25 significant landslides per year. Climate change is intensifying atmospheric river events, which deliver the prolonged, heavy rainfall that destabilizes slopes. Urban flooding from overwhelmed stormwater systems compounds the problem, particularly in low-lying areas like South Park and Georgetown that also face tidal influence from the Duwamish River.

### Wildfire Smoke and Air Quality

Washington's wildfire seasons are intensifying. Acres burned annually in the state have more than doubled since the 1980s. Seattle sits downwind of fire-prone forests in the Cascades and Eastern Washington, receiving smoke that degrades air quality for days to weeks at a time. PM2.5 exposure during smoke events increases cardiovascular and respiratory hospitalizations by 8–15%. The economic cost includes lost productivity, school closures, and tourism decline during peak summer season.

## Local Climate Action

Seattle's 2013 Climate Action Plan, updated in 2018, targets net-zero emissions by 2050, with interim goals of 58% reduction by 2030 (from 2008 levels). The city benefits from Seattle City Light, the municipal utility that has been carbon-neutral since 2005 through its hydroelectric portfolio and renewable energy credits.

The 2023 Building Performance Standard requires commercial and multifamily buildings over 20,000 square feet to meet declining energy use intensity targets, with compliance beginning in 2027. Seattle's Electrification Incentive Program provides rebates up to $10,000 for heat pump installation in existing buildings.

The city's Green Stormwater Infrastructure program has invested over $200 million in rain gardens, bioswales, permeable pavement, and creek restoration projects to manage stormwater and reduce flooding. The RainWise program reimburses property owners up to $7,800 for installing rain gardens and cisterns in combined sewer areas.

## Regulations & Incentives

Washington's Climate Commitment Act (2021) established a cap-and-invest program—the second state-level carbon market in the nation. Revenue supports climate investments, with $2 billion allocated in the first biennium. The state's Clean Energy Transformation Act mandates carbon-neutral electricity by 2030 and 100% renewable by 2045.

Seattle's Energy Code exceeds state minimums, requiring new buildings to meet electric-ready standards and achieve high-performance envelopes. The city's oil heat conversion requirement mandates replacement of oil-fired heating systems at time of sale. Washington's sales tax exemption for heat pumps and solar installations reduces upfront costs.

Puget Sound Energy, which serves surrounding areas, offers rebates for heat pumps, insulation, and weatherization. The state's PACE-enabling legislation supports commercial resilience and efficiency financing.

## Federal Funding Opportunities

IRA incentives are highly impactful in the Seattle market. HEEHRA rebates up to $14,000 stack with Seattle City Light and state incentives, making whole-home electrification accessible for moderate-income households. The 30% solar ITC and standalone storage credit support distributed energy deployment, complementing the region's hydroelectric grid.

FEMA BRIC awarded Washington $14.2 million in 2023. Seattle's landslide mitigation and stormwater projects compete strongly given the city's well-documented risk and high benefit-cost ratios. EPA Clean Water State Revolving Fund loans support the city's combined sewer overflow elimination program.

NOAA's National Coastal Resilience Fund supports Puget Sound shoreline restoration projects. The DOT PROTECT program funds climate-resilient transportation infrastructure, relevant to Seattle's flood- and landslide-vulnerable road network.

## How Council Fire Can Help

Seattle's climate risks are evolving faster than its infrastructure can adapt. Council Fire helps property owners, developers, and city agencies close the gap between emerging hazards and built environment performance.

For building owners facing the 2027 Building Performance Standard, Council Fire provides energy benchmarking, decarbonization planning, and incentive optimization. We stack Seattle City Light rebates, state heat pump incentives, and IRA credits to minimize retrofit costs.

Our stormwater and landslide expertise supports residential and commercial property owners managing slope stability and drainage challenges. For municipal agencies, Council Fire brings federal grant strategy and benefit-cost analysis to BRIC, EPA, and Army Corps applications. From heat resilience retrofits to green infrastructure design, Council Fire delivers the technical depth that Seattle's compound climate challenges require.

## Frequently Asked Questions

### What are the biggest climate risks facing Seattle?

Extreme heat is an emerging and potentially deadly threat—the 2021 heat dome killed over 600 people regionwide and exposed the vulnerability of Seattle's housing stock. Landslides triggered by intensifying rainfall events damage dozens of properties annually. Wildfire smoke from regional fires degrades air quality for weeks each summer.

### Does Seattle have a climate action plan?

Yes. Seattle targets net-zero emissions by 2050, with a 58% reduction by 2030. The city benefits from carbon-neutral municipal electricity. The 2023 Building Performance Standard requires large buildings to meet energy benchmarks. Green stormwater infrastructure investments exceed $200 million.
