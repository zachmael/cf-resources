## Climate Snapshot

Phoenix is the fifth-largest city in the United States, with a population of 1.65 million and a metro area of nearly 5 million. Located in the Sonoran Desert at 1,100 feet elevation, Phoenix is the hottest large city in the country—and getting hotter. The metro area has sprawled rapidly across the Salt River Valley, replacing desert landscape with asphalt, concrete, and rooftops that absorb and re-radiate heat.

In 2023, Phoenix set a record with 31 consecutive days at or above 110°F, from June 30 through July 30. Maricopa County recorded 645 heat-associated deaths that year—a 52% increase over 2022 and the highest toll on record. The city's overnight low temperatures are rising even faster than daytime highs, with lows regularly staying above 90°F during heat waves, preventing the human body from recovering. In July 2023, a woman suffered third-degree burns after collapsing on a parking lot surface measured at 170°F.

Water supply is the other existential concern. Phoenix draws from the Colorado River (via the Central Arizona Project canal), the Salt and Verde Rivers, and groundwater. Colorado River allocations have been cut repeatedly, with Arizona absorbing the largest share of mandatory reductions under the 2023 supplemental agreement. Lake Mead, the system's primary reservoir, dropped to 22% capacity in 2022 before partial recovery.

## Top Climate Risks

### Extreme Heat
Phoenix averages 110 days per year above 100°F, and that number is climbing. The urban heat island effect adds 10-15°F to nighttime temperatures compared to surrounding desert. Heat kills more people in Maricopa County than hurricanes, tornadoes, and floods combined kill nationally in most years. The unhoused population bears extreme risk—approximately 40% of heat-related deaths in 2023 involved people experiencing homelessness. Economic losses from heat-related productivity declines exceed $1 billion annually for the metro.

### Water Scarcity
Arizona's Colorado River allocation has been cut by 592,000 acre-feet under the Drought Contingency Plan—roughly 30% of the state's total allocation. The Central Arizona Project canal, which delivers Colorado River water 336 miles from Lake Havasu to Phoenix, is the first supply to be curtailed during shortages. Phoenix has invested heavily in water recycling (returning 90% of its wastewater to the supply) and banking underground reserves, but the city's 40-year water plan depends on assumptions about Colorado River flows that are increasingly optimistic.

### Dust Storms and Air Quality
Haboobs—massive dust storms driven by monsoon outflows—can engulf the metro with walls of dust 5,000 feet high, reducing visibility to near zero and depositing fine particulate matter that triggers respiratory events. The July 5, 2011, haboob was among the largest ever recorded, stretching 100 miles wide. Ozone pollution is a chronic problem; Phoenix fails to meet EPA ozone standards, with 40+ exceedance days per year. Dust and heat interact to create compounding public health impacts, particularly for outdoor workers in construction, agriculture, and landscaping.

## Local Climate Action

Phoenix's 2021 Climate Action Plan targets carbon neutrality by 2050, with an interim goal of 50% emissions reduction by 2030. The city's Environmental Sustainability Program coordinates initiatives across five pillars: buildings, transportation, energy, waste, and adaptation.

The city has deployed 100 "cool corridors" with shade structures, misting stations, and reflective pavement. Phoenix's Cool Pavement Pilot Program, launched in 2020, has treated over 100 miles of residential streets with a reflective sealcoat that reduces surface temperatures by 10-12°F. The city's Tree and Shade Master Plan targets 25% canopy cover by 2030, up from the current 9.6%—one of the lowest rates among major U.S. cities.

Phoenix's Office of Heat Response and Mitigation, established in 2021 as the first of its kind in the nation, coordinates heat preparedness, cooling center operations, and public communication during extreme heat events.

## Regulations & Incentives

Arizona lacks a statewide renewable portfolio standard or building energy code mandate—code adoption is left to individual jurisdictions. Phoenix adopted the 2018 IECC with amendments. The city's Green Construction Code requires energy efficiency measures for new commercial buildings but does not mandate electrification.

Salt River Project (SRP) and Arizona Public Service (APS), the two primary utilities, offer solar incentive programs and time-of-use rate structures that incentivize battery storage. APS provides a $500 rebate for residential battery systems and demand-response payments of $1-$3 per kWh of dispatched storage. SRP offers rebates of up to $1,800 for qualifying heat pump installations.

Maricopa County's Home Weatherization Assistance Program provides free weatherization services for income-qualifying households, including insulation, duct sealing, and HVAC upgrades.

## Federal Funding Opportunities

Arizona's IRA allocation through the Home Electrification and Appliance Rebates program totals approximately $113 million, with individual households eligible for up to $14,000. The 30% federal solar Investment Tax Credit and the $7,500 EV tax credit are particularly impactful in a state with abundant sunshine and high vehicle miles traveled.

FEMA's BRIC program awarded Arizona $15.3 million in 2023, with eligible projects including extreme heat mitigation, urban forestry, and flood control. The Bureau of Reclamation invested $4 billion through the IRA for Colorado River water conservation, with Arizona receiving a substantial share for agricultural-to-urban water transfers and conservation incentives.

The EPA's Heat Island Reduction Program funds cool roof and cool pavement projects. HUD's CDBG program provides Phoenix with approximately $20 million annually, portions of which support heat resilience and housing improvements for vulnerable populations.

## How Council Fire Can Help

Council Fire brings climate resilience expertise to desert communities facing the compounding challenges of extreme heat, water scarcity, and rapid growth. In Phoenix, we help city agencies and developers design heat-adaptive infrastructure, develop water conservation strategies, and secure federal funding for resilience projects. Our team has experience with cool corridor design, urban forestry planning in arid environments, and building performance optimization for extreme heat conditions.

We work with municipal partners to navigate the BRIC application process, structure WaterSMART proposals, and align local investments with IRA incentive programs to maximize climate impact per dollar spent.

## Frequently Asked Questions

### What are the biggest climate risks facing Phoenix?
Extreme heat is Phoenix's most acute threat—645 people died from heat-associated causes in Maricopa County in 2023. Water scarcity is the long-term existential risk, with Colorado River allocations cut by 30% and Lake Mead at historic lows. Dust storms and chronic ozone pollution compound public health impacts, particularly for outdoor workers and the unhoused population.

### Does Phoenix have a climate action plan?
Yes. Phoenix's 2021 Climate Action Plan targets carbon neutrality by 2050 and 50% emissions reduction by 2030. The city established the nation's first Office of Heat Response and Mitigation in 2021 and has deployed over 100 miles of cool pavement, 100 cool corridors, and set a goal of reaching 25% tree canopy cover by 2030 (up from 9.6%).

### What federal funding is available for climate resilience in Arizona?
Arizona has access to $113 million in IRA home electrification rebates, $15.3 million from FEMA BRIC (2023), and a substantial share of $4 billion in Bureau of Reclamation Colorado River water conservation funding. Additional resources include HUD CDBG ($20 million annually to Phoenix), EPA heat island reduction grants, and DOE weatherization assistance.

### How does Phoenix's heat affect public health equity?
Heat deaths in Phoenix disproportionately affect the unhoused (40% of heat fatalities in 2023), outdoor workers, elderly residents, and low-income renters without reliable air conditioning. South Phoenix neighborhoods have canopy cover below 5% and surface temperatures that exceed affluent areas by 15-20°F. The city's cooling center network provides daytime refuge, but nighttime heat remains deadly when overnight lows stay above 90°F.
