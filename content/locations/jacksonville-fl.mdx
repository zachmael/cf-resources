## Climate Snapshot

Jacksonville, Florida, is the largest city by land area in the contiguous United States at 875 square miles, with a population of 985,000. The city straddles the St. Johns River, which flows northward for 310 miles before emptying into the Atlantic Ocean at Jacksonville's doorstep. This unique hydrology—a slow, north-flowing river meeting ocean tides—creates compound flood risk that few cities face.

Hurricane Matthew in 2016 brought a 5.6-foot storm surge up the St. Johns, producing the worst flooding in downtown Jacksonville since 1964. Over 2,000 structures were damaged, and the city's emergency management system was stretched to capacity. Hurricane Irma in 2017 was even worse—a record 5.5-foot surge combined with heavy rainfall to flood 6,300 structures and cause $1.2 billion in damages across Duval County. Streets in San Marco, Riverside, and Springfield were under 3–4 feet of water.

The 2024 hurricane season brought Hurricane Milton, which, while centered on Tampa, drove significant surge and rainfall into Northeast Florida. The compounding pattern is clear: Jacksonville faces escalating flood risk from a combination of sea-level rise, hurricane surge, riverine flooding, and intense rainfall—often simultaneously.

## Top Climate Risks

### Compound Flooding—River, Ocean, and Rain

Jacksonville's defining risk is compound flooding. The St. Johns River's low gradient and tidal influence mean that hurricane surge, river flooding, and heavy rainfall can all peak simultaneously. The river's 8,840-square-mile watershed acts as a massive funnel, concentrating runoff at the Jacksonville bottleneck. FEMA maps place over 80,000 structures in the 100-year floodplain—more than almost any city in the country. Climate change intensifies all three flood drivers.

### Hurricane Wind and Storm Surge

Jacksonville's position on Florida's northeast coast puts it in the path of Atlantic hurricanes tracking up the coastline or crossing the Florida peninsula. Storm surge in the St. Johns River can reach 8–12 feet during a major hurricane, with the river's northward flow trapping surge water for days. Wind damage compounds flood impacts—Irma's 75 mph gusts knocked out power to 400,000 customers for up to two weeks.

### Extreme Heat and Humidity

Jacksonville averages 82 days above 90°F annually, with heat index values regularly exceeding 105°F. Projections show 100–120 days above 90°F by 2050. The combination of high heat and humidity creates dangerous conditions for outdoor workers, elderly residents, and those without reliable AC. Northwest Jacksonville, Springfield, and parts of the Westside experience the highest heat exposure with the least tree canopy.

## Local Climate Action

Jacksonville adopted its Resilience Strategy in 2020, identifying flooding, extreme heat, and economic inequality as top priorities. The city established a Resilience Officer position and committed to integrating climate risk into capital planning and development review.

The JEA (municipal utility) launched a sustainability roadmap targeting 30% renewable energy by 2030 and carbon neutrality in electricity generation by 2045. JEA's SolarSmart program has deployed 260 MW of community and utility-scale solar capacity.

The city's updated Comprehensive Plan (2024) strengthens floodplain management policies, restricts new residential density in high-risk surge zones, and requires climate risk assessments for major developments. The $235 million Resilience and Flood Protection bond, approved by voters in 2023, funds stormwater infrastructure upgrades, seawall repairs, and neighborhood drainage improvements across the city.

## Regulations & Incentives

Florida's building code mandates wind-resistant construction statewide, with enhanced requirements in the Wind-Borne Debris Region that includes Jacksonville. The state's flood regulations require new construction to meet FEMA standards with 1 foot of freeboard.

Jacksonville's local floodplain ordinance exceeds state minimums in several areas, including higher elevation requirements for critical facilities and restrictions on fill in the floodplain. The city's stormwater utility fee funds drainage maintenance and capital improvements; credits are available for properties with on-site stormwater management.

Florida's PACE program enables residential and commercial financing for wind mitigation, flood barriers, solar installations, and energy efficiency. JEA offers rebates for efficient HVAC systems, solar installations, and smart home energy management. The My Safe Florida Home program provides grants up to $10,000 for residential wind and flood hardening.

## Federal Funding Opportunities

Jacksonville's repeated disaster declarations unlock ongoing FEMA assistance. HMGP funds from Hurricanes Matthew, Irma, and Milton total hundreds of millions for Duval County. FEMA BRIC awarded Florida $23.4 million in 2023.

The Army Corps of Engineers' Jacksonville Harbor Deepening and St. Johns River flood studies evaluate both navigation and flood risk management improvements. The NFIP Community Rating System rewards Jacksonville's floodplain management efforts with flood insurance premium discounts for policyholders.

IRA incentives provide HEEHRA rebates up to $14,000, 30% solar ITC, and Greenhouse Gas Reduction Fund financing. DOT PROTECT formula funding supports climate-resilient transportation infrastructure—critical for Jacksonville's sprawling road network.

## How Council Fire Can Help

Jacksonville's geographic complexity—a massive footprint, a unique river system, and compound flood dynamics—requires resilience strategies scaled to the city's scope. Council Fire helps municipal agencies, developers, and property owners translate risk into action.

We support the city's $235 million resilience bond implementation with project management, engineering oversight, and benefit-cost analysis for federal funding leverage. For developers navigating updated floodplain regulations, Council Fire provides site-specific flood risk assessments and adaptive design guidance.

Our federal grant practice helps Jacksonville-area clients build competitive BRIC, HMGP, and FMA applications. Council Fire's experience with compound flood modeling and nature-based solutions positions us to design interventions that work with Jacksonville's complex hydrology rather than against it.

## Frequently Asked Questions

### What are the biggest climate risks facing Jacksonville?

Compound flooding—where hurricane surge, riverine flooding from the St. Johns River, and intense rainfall converge simultaneously—is Jacksonville's defining risk. The city has 80,000+ structures in the 100-year floodplain. Hurricane wind damage, extreme heat, and sea-level rise compound the threat.

### Does Jacksonville have a climate action plan?

Jacksonville adopted a Resilience Strategy in 2020 and approved a $235 million resilience bond in 2023 for flood protection and stormwater upgrades. JEA targets 30% renewable energy by 2030 and carbon-neutral electricity by 2045. The updated Comprehensive Plan (2024) strengthens floodplain management and integrates climate risk into development review.

### What federal funding is available for climate resilience in Florida?

Florida receives major FEMA allocations through BRIC ($23.4 million in 2023), HMGP following disaster declarations, and FMA for repetitive-loss properties. IRA electrification and solar incentives apply statewide. Army Corps studies address flood risk. Florida's My Safe Florida Home program provides residential hardening grants.
