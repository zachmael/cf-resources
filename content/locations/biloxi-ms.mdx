## Climate Snapshot

Biloxi sits on a narrow peninsula between the Mississippi Sound and the Back Bay of Biloxi, giving the city water exposure on three sides. With a peak elevation of roughly 25 feet and much of the developed area below 15 feet, the city is acutely vulnerable to storm surge from Gulf hurricanes. Biloxi's modern history is defined by Hurricane Katrina (2005), which pushed 28 feet of surge into the beachfront, destroyed the historic waterfront, killed 53 residents, and caused over $6 billion in damage to Harrison County.

The Mississippi Gulf Coast has warmed approximately 2°F since 1970, with the Gulf of Mexico surface temperature increase driving more intense rainfall events and supporting stronger hurricanes. Tide gauge data at the Biloxi Bay entrance shows roughly 12 inches of sea level rise over the past 60 years. The region receives approximately 64 inches of rain annually—among the highest in the nation—with increasingly intense downpours overwhelming drainage infrastructure.

Biloxi's economy relies heavily on the casino and tourism industry, with 11 casino resorts operating along the beachfront and Back Bay. These facilities, required by Mississippi law to be located on or over navigable water, represent billions in investment directly exposed to storm surge. The city's population (46,000) has not fully recovered from Katrina's displacement.

## Top Climate Risks

### Hurricane & Storm Surge

Katrina demonstrated Biloxi's extreme surge vulnerability—28 feet of surge penetrated over a mile inland, destroying everything in its path. The Mississippi Sound's shallow water and funnel-shaped geography amplify surge. NOAA SLOSH models show 15–25 feet of surge possible from a Category 4 storm. Since Katrina, multiple storms have caused additional damage, including Hurricane Zeta (2020), which brought 9-foot surge and 110 mph winds.

### Coastal Erosion & Barrier Island Loss

The Mississippi barrier islands (Ship, Horn, Petit Bois, Cat) provide the first line of defense against Gulf storm energy. These islands have lost over 60% of their land area since 1850, reducing their wave-attenuation function. Deer Island, directly south of Biloxi, has eroded significantly. Without barrier island restoration, the Mississippi Sound coast faces progressively higher wave energy and surge during storms.

### Extreme Precipitation & Drainage Failure

Biloxi's stormwater system was rebuilt after Katrina but continues to struggle with the increasing intensity of rainfall events. The city experienced a 1-in-500-year rainfall event in 2023 that flooded the Back Bay area with over 12 inches of rain in 6 hours. The flat terrain and tidal influence on drainage outfalls create compound flooding during rain-on-tide events. Sea level rise further reduces gravity drainage capacity.

## Local Climate Action

The Mississippi Gulf Coast Resilience Plan (2024), coordinated through the Gulf Coast Community Design Studio and Mississippi State University, establishes a regional resilience framework covering Harrison, Hancock, and Jackson counties. The plan integrates hurricane risk reduction, economic diversification, and environmental restoration.

The City of Biloxi's post-Katrina rebuilding enforced elevated construction standards that have proven their value in subsequent storms. The city's Comprehensive Plan (2023 update) includes a coastal resilience chapter that discourages density increases in the highest-risk surge zones and encourages infill development on higher ground north of the railroad tracks.

The Mississippi Coastal Improvements Program (MsCIP), a $1.1 billion Army Corps partnership, is the single largest resilience investment on the Mississippi coast, including ecosystem restoration, surge barrier feasibility, and community resilience projects.

## Regulations & Incentives

Mississippi adopted the 2021 International Building Code statewide, with the three coastal counties enforcing additional wind-speed provisions (150 mph design speed). Harrison County requires 2 feet of freeboard above BFE for new residential construction. Mississippi's Windstorm Underwriting Association (MWUA) provides wind coverage for coastal properties that private insurers won't cover, but premiums have risen significantly since Katrina.

Mississippi's net metering law allows solar systems up to 25 kW for residential interconnection. Mississippi Power offers commercial energy efficiency rebates and demand response programs. The state's energy code adoption is limited, creating opportunities for voluntary green building adoption.

## Federal Funding Opportunities

The Gulf of Mexico Energy Security Act (GOMESA) directs a portion of offshore oil and gas revenue to Gulf states for coastal restoration. Mississippi receives approximately $30–50 million annually, administered through the Mississippi Department of Environmental Quality for barrier island restoration, living shoreline construction, and coastal land conservation.

The RESTORE Act (Deepwater Horizon settlement) has allocated over $500 million to Mississippi for coastal restoration and economic recovery. Projects include barrier island restoration (Ship Island's Camille Cut closure—$350 million), marsh creation, and water quality improvement.

FEMA HMGP funding post-Katrina and subsequent storms has supported over $200 million in Mississippi coast mitigation projects, including property elevation, safe room construction, and infrastructure hardening.

The Army Corps' MsCIP program represents $1.1 billion in authorized investment for comprehensive coastal risk reduction along the Mississippi coast.

## How Council Fire Can Help

Council Fire's Gulf Coast practice brings deep post-disaster resilience expertise to the Mississippi coast. We support municipalities with hazard mitigation planning, RESTORE Act and GOMESA project development, and Army Corps coordination for coastal protection projects.

Our team helps casino and hospitality operators with climate risk assessment, business continuity planning, and resilience investments that protect guest safety and business value. For municipal and county clients, we provide federal grant strategy, stormwater master planning, and community engagement for resilience initiatives that build public support and ensure equitable outcomes.

## Frequently Asked Questions

### How has Biloxi recovered from Hurricane Katrina?

Biloxi has rebuilt substantially since Katrina, with over $2 billion in casino reinvestment, new beachfront development, and infrastructure reconstruction. However, the city's population remains below pre-Katrina levels, and many historic neighborhoods were permanently altered. The rebuilt environment is more resilient—elevated structures, stronger building codes, improved drainage—but the fundamental geographic vulnerability remains. The casino industry recovered and expanded, generating over $1 billion in annual gaming revenue for the coast.

### What is the RESTORE Act doing for the Mississippi coast?

The RESTORE Act directs Deepwater Horizon civil penalty funds to Gulf states for environmental and economic restoration. Mississippi's allocation exceeds $500 million, funding barrier island restoration (including the $350 million Camille Cut closure on Ship Island), oyster reef construction, marsh creation, and water quality projects. The Mississippi Department of Environmental Quality and the Gulf Coast Ecosystem Restoration Council administer these funds.

### Are the barrier islands being restored?

Yes. The Camille Cut closure project is reconnecting the two halves of Ship Island (split by Hurricane Camille in 1969 and widened by subsequent storms) using 12 million cubic yards of sand. The $350 million project, funded through RESTORE and MsCIP, was substantially completed in 2024. Additional barrier island projects include sand placement on Horn Island and Petit Bois Island shoreline stabilization. These islands reduce wave energy and storm surge reaching the mainland coast by 30–50%.

### How do Mississippi's casino regulations affect climate risk?

Mississippi law requires casino facilities to be located on or over navigable water, placing them directly in the surge zone. After Katrina destroyed multiple floating casinos, the legislature allowed casinos to move up to 800 feet from the waterline but maintained the navigable-water requirement. Most rebuilt casinos are now elevated structures on pilings near the beachfront or Back Bay. While more resilient than the pre-Katrina barges, they remain among the most surge-exposed commercial structures on the coast.
