## Climate Snapshot

Dallas, Texas has a city population of approximately 1.3 million and anchors a metro area of 7.6 million—the fourth-largest in the United States. The city sits on the blackland prairie of north-central Texas, with the Trinity River running through its center. Dallas's climate is already extreme—summer temperatures routinely exceed 100°F, severe thunderstorms produce damaging hail and tornadoes, and drought periodically threatens water supplies. Climate change is amplifying every one of these risks.

The February 2021 Winter Storm Uri exposed Dallas's infrastructure vulnerabilities with devastating clarity. Temperatures plunged to -2°F—the coldest reading in 72 years—and the ERCOT grid collapsed, leaving millions without power for days. In Dallas, 111 people died from cold exposure, carbon monoxide poisoning, and medical equipment failures. Water mains burst across the city, and the damage bill exceeded $900 million in Dallas County alone. In August 2022, Dallas experienced a different extreme—a flash flood event dropped 10 inches of rain in 6 hours on the southern half of the city, flooding 5,000 homes and causing $200 million in damages along the Trinity River tributaries.

Dallas recorded 49 days above 100°F in 2023, shattering the previous record of 42 set in 1980. The city's heat island—driven by 260 square miles of sprawling, car-dependent development—pushes temperatures 8-12°F higher in commercial corridors than in surrounding areas. Southern Dallas, the city's lowest-income area, consistently records the highest temperatures and has the least tree canopy.

## Top Climate Risks

### Extreme Heat
Dallas's heat is already deadly and intensifying. The 49 days above 100°F in 2023 killed 34 people in Dallas County. Climate projections suggest Dallas could experience 70+ days above 100°F annually by 2060 under moderate emissions scenarios. A 2022 UT Dallas study found that southern Dallas neighborhoods—predominantly Black and Hispanic—experience temperatures 12°F higher than Highland Park and other affluent northern enclaves. Cooling degree days have increased 35% since 2000, driving electricity costs that consume over 10% of income for 300,000+ low-income Dallas households.

### Flash Flooding
The Trinity River's 1,700-square-mile watershed above Dallas, combined with clay soils and extensive impervious surfaces, creates severe flash flood risk. Dallas has over 11,000 structures in the 100-year floodplain, with replacement values exceeding $8 billion. The Trinity River Corridor Project—a $400 million flood control, recreation, and transportation initiative—provides protection along the main channel, but tributary flooding along Five Mile Creek, White Rock Creek, and Bachman Branch remains the primary threat. The August 2022 event demonstrated that current infrastructure cannot handle increasingly intense rainfall.

### Grid Vulnerability and Winter Storms
Winter Storm Uri revealed that Dallas's infrastructure—designed for heat—is critically vulnerable to cold extremes. The ERCOT grid failure killed 246 people statewide and caused over $80 billion in damages. While Texas has since mandated limited weatherization of generation and transmission assets, ERCOT's isolated grid remains vulnerable to both extreme cold and extreme heat demand spikes. Summer 2023 saw ERCOT issue multiple conservation appeals as demand neared record levels during the 49-day heat wave.

## Local Climate Action

Dallas adopted its Comprehensive Environmental & Climate Action Plan (CECAP) in 2020, targeting a 43% reduction in community emissions by 2030 and net-zero by 2050 from a 2015 baseline. The plan was developed with significant community input, particularly from southern Dallas neighborhoods bearing the greatest environmental burden.

The Trinity River Corridor Project remains Dallas's most significant resilience investment, with over $400 million spent on levee improvements, flood control, and ecosystem restoration. The city's Cool Dallas Action Plan (2023) targets a 5°F reduction in urban heat island intensity by 2035 through tree planting (500,000 trees), cool roofs, and cool pavement pilots.

Dallas's Green Building Program requires all city-funded projects to achieve LEED Silver. The city installed 12 MW of solar on municipal buildings and facilities between 2020 and 2024. DART (Dallas Area Rapid Transit) is expanding its Silver Line commuter rail and transitioning to a compressed natural gas and electric bus fleet, with 150 electric buses ordered for delivery by 2027.

## Regulations & Incentives

Texas has no state-level climate plan or renewable portfolio standard beyond its expired 2015 target, but the deregulated ERCOT market has driven massive renewable energy growth—Texas leads the nation in wind generation and ranks second in solar. Dallas residents can choose 100% renewable electricity plans through the competitive retail market.

Oncor, Dallas's transmission and distribution utility, offers rebates for energy efficiency improvements, demand response programs, and a community solar pilot. Dallas's stormwater drainage utility charge provides credits for on-site stormwater management. The city's PACE program finances commercial clean energy and resilience improvements.

Texas's Property Tax Exemption for Solar and Wind exempts the added value from property taxes. The Texas LoanSTAR program provides low-interest loans for public building energy efficiency improvements. The North Central Texas Council of Governments (NCTCOG) administers regional air quality programs that provide funding for emission reduction projects.

## Federal Funding Opportunities

Texas's IRA Home Energy Rebate allocation is $587 million—the largest of any state. Dallas residents can access up to $8,000 for heat pumps and $14,000 for income-qualified households. Federal 30% tax credits for solar, batteries, and efficiency improvements run through 2032.

FEMA BRIC awarded $20 million to Dallas County in 2023 for flood mitigation along Five Mile Creek and White Rock Creek. FEMA's Flood Mitigation Assistance program has funded $45 million in repetitive-loss acquisitions in the Trinity River corridor since 2019. The Army Corps of Engineers manages the Trinity River levee system, with $300 million in Bipartisan Infrastructure Law funding for levee rehabilitation.

DOE Weatherization allocated $65 million to Texas in 2023. HUD's CDBG program provides Dallas approximately $25 million annually. EPA Climate Pollution Reduction Grants provided the North Texas region with planning funds, with implementation grants of up to $500 million available competitively. FHWA's PROTECT formula program provides Texas $250 million annually for transportation resilience.

## Frequently Asked Questions

### What are the biggest climate risks facing Dallas?
Dallas faces extreme heat (49 days above 100°F in 2023, killing 34 people, with 12°F temperature disparities between neighborhoods), flash flooding (11,000+ floodplain structures worth $8 billion, with the August 2022 event causing $200 million in damages), and grid vulnerability (Winter Storm Uri killed 111 people in Dallas County and caused $900 million in damages). All three risks are intensifying.

### Does Dallas have a climate action plan?
Yes. Dallas's Comprehensive Environmental & Climate Action Plan (CECAP, 2020) targets net-zero by 2050 and 43% reduction by 2030. The Cool Dallas Action Plan aims to reduce heat island intensity by 5°F through 500,000 trees and cool infrastructure. The $400 million Trinity River Corridor Project addresses flooding. Dallas requires LEED Silver for city-funded projects and has installed 12 MW of municipal solar.

### What federal funding is available for climate resilience in Texas?
Texas has the largest IRA Home Energy Rebate allocation at $587 million. Dallas can access FEMA BRIC ($20 million in 2023), FEMA Flood Mitigation Assistance ($45 million since 2019), Army Corps levee funding ($300 million from the BIL), DOE Weatherization ($65 million for Texas in 2023), and HUD CDBG ($25 million annually). Federal 30% tax credits for solar and batteries run through 2032.

### How did Winter Storm Uri affect Dallas?
Winter Storm Uri in February 2021 caused 111 deaths and $900 million in damages in Dallas County. Temperatures fell to -2°F, the ERCOT grid collapsed, and millions lost power for days. Water mains burst citywide. While Texas has since required limited weatherization of grid infrastructure, the ERCOT system remains vulnerable to extreme weather demand spikes—a concern Dallas's CECAP and resilience planning must address.
