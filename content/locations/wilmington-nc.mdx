## Climate Snapshot

Wilmington sits on the Cape Fear River, roughly eight miles from the Atlantic Ocean, placing it squarely in the path of Atlantic hurricanes and nor'easters. The city's low elevation—much of it under 40 feet above sea level—makes it acutely vulnerable to storm surge, tidal flooding, and sea level rise. Between 2016 and 2024, Wilmington experienced three major hurricane landfalls: Matthew (2016), Florence (2018), and Isaias (2020), each causing hundreds of millions of dollars in damage.

Average annual temperatures in the Wilmington metro have risen roughly 2°F since the mid-20th century, and the region now records about 15 more days per year above 90°F compared to the 1970s. Sea levels at the Wilmington tide gauge have risen approximately 12 inches over the past century, with the rate accelerating to roughly 3.5 mm per year over the last two decades. These trends are reshaping insurance markets, infrastructure planning, and real estate values across New Hanover County.

The region's economy depends heavily on tourism, the port, and military installations—all of which face direct climate exposure. Meanwhile, rapid population growth (New Hanover County added nearly 30,000 residents between 2010 and 2023) is intensifying development in flood-prone areas.

## Top Climate Risks

### Hurricane & Storm Surge Flooding

Wilmington's FEMA flood maps show that roughly 30% of structures in New Hanover County sit within the 100-year floodplain. Hurricane Florence dumped over 30 inches of rain in 72 hours, flooding neighborhoods miles from any coastline. The Cape Fear River crested at 35.9 feet—its highest recorded level. NOAA projects that a Category 3 storm could push 10–15 feet of surge into downtown Wilmington.

### Sea Level Rise & Chronic Tidal Flooding

The North Carolina Coastal Resources Commission's 2023 science panel projects 6 to 14 inches of additional sea level rise by 2045 and 1 to 3 feet by 2070 along the southern coast. Wrightsville Beach and Carolina Beach already experience "sunny-day" flooding during king tides. Roads like US-421 and sections of Market Street regularly see tidal inundation that disrupts commutes and damages pavement.

### Extreme Heat & Inland Flooding

Wilmington's humid subtropical climate amplifies heat index values well beyond air temperature. Days where the heat index exceeds 105°F have increased by roughly 40% since 2000. Simultaneously, heavier rainfall events—driven by warmer ocean temperatures—are overwhelming stormwater systems designed for lower-intensity storms. The city's older neighborhoods, many with combined drainage infrastructure, are especially at risk.

## Local Climate Action

New Hanover County adopted its Multi-Jurisdictional Hazard Mitigation Plan update in 2023, integrating climate projections into all hazard categories for the first time. The plan identifies 47 mitigation actions, including buyouts of repetitive-loss properties, living shoreline installations, and upgraded stormwater conveyance.

The City of Wilmington's Strategic Plan 2025 includes a sustainability pillar targeting a 40% reduction in municipal greenhouse gas emissions by 2035 (from a 2019 baseline). The city has installed 1.2 MW of solar across municipal buildings, transitioned 15% of its fleet to EVs or hybrids, and adopted a green building policy requiring LEED Silver or equivalent for new city facilities.

Cape Fear Public Utility Authority completed a $45 million resilience upgrade to its Sweeney Water Treatment Plant in 2024, raising critical systems above the 500-year flood elevation and adding backup power capacity for 14 days of autonomous operation.

## Regulations & Incentives

North Carolina's Coastal Area Management Act (CAMA) requires permits for development within Areas of Environmental Concern, including oceanfront setbacks that vary by erosion rate. New Hanover County enforces a 2-foot freeboard requirement above base flood elevation for new construction—stricter than the state minimum.

The state offers a 35% tax credit for renewable energy and energy efficiency improvements to commercial buildings (capped at $2.5 million per installation). Duke Energy Progress runs rebate programs for commercial HVAC upgrades, building envelope improvements, and LED retrofits. The NC Clean Energy Technology Center maintains a database of current incentives at dsireusa.org.

Wilmington's Unified Development Ordinance, updated in 2024, requires low-impact development (LID) stormwater practices for all new projects disturbing more than 10,000 square feet, including permeable pavement, bioretention cells, and cisterns.

## Federal Funding Opportunities

FEMA's Building Resilient Infrastructure and Communities (BRIC) program allocated $1 billion nationally in FY2025. New Hanover County has received BRIC funding in previous cycles for drainage improvements and has active applications for living shoreline projects. Individual project caps are $50 million.

The EPA's Climate Pollution Reduction Grants (CPRG) provided $4.6 billion through the Inflation Reduction Act, with implementation grants of up to $500 million available to states and metro areas. The Wilmington MSA is eligible through the Cape Fear Council of Governments.

NOAA's National Coastal Resilience Fund (administered through NFWF) awards $30–$50 million annually for nature-based solutions. Previous NC recipients include living shoreline and marsh restoration projects in Brunswick and Pender counties.

HUD's Community Development Block Grant–Disaster Recovery (CDBG-DR) program has channeled over $800 million into North Carolina since Hurricane Florence, funding buyouts, infrastructure hardening, and affordable housing resilience in the Wilmington area.

## How Council Fire Can Help

Council Fire works with coastal communities navigating the intersection of rapid growth and escalating climate risk. In Wilmington, our team can support hazard mitigation plan development and updates, ensuring alignment with the latest NOAA and NC DEQ climate projections. We bring deep experience in federal grant strategy—from BRIC and CPRG applications to CDBG-DR action plan administration.

Our sustainability consulting practice helps municipalities and private developers meet green building standards, design resilient stormwater systems, and implement energy efficiency programs that reduce operating costs while cutting emissions. For port and industrial clients along the Cape Fear corridor, we provide vulnerability assessments and adaptation roadmaps calibrated to site-specific flood, wind, and heat exposure.

## Frequently Asked Questions

### How much has sea level risen in Wilmington, and what's projected?

Sea level at the Wilmington tide gauge has risen approximately 12 inches over the past century. The NC Coastal Resources Commission's 2023 science panel projects an additional 6 to 14 inches by 2045 and 1 to 3 feet by 2070, depending on emissions trajectory. These projections directly affect flood insurance rates, building codes, and infrastructure design standards.

### What flood insurance changes should Wilmington property owners expect?

FEMA's Risk Rating 2.0, fully implemented in 2023, repriced flood insurance based on individual property characteristics rather than zone-based maps. Many Wilmington properties saw premium increases of 10–25% annually (capped at 18% per year by Congress). Properties with repeated flood claims face even steeper adjustments. Mitigation measures—elevating structures, installing flood vents, or relocating utilities—can reduce premiums significantly.

### Are there grants available for homeowners to make their properties more resilient?

Yes. North Carolina's Hazard Mitigation Grant Program (HMGP), funded through FEMA, offers grants for elevation, acquisition/demolition, and retrofit of flood-prone homes. The state's Resilient Homes Program, funded through CDBG-DR, provides up to $50,000 for repairs and resilience upgrades to low- and moderate-income homeowners. New Hanover County periodically opens application rounds for both programs.

### What is Wilmington doing about stormwater flooding?

The city has invested over $60 million in stormwater infrastructure since 2018, including conveyance upgrades, pump station installations, and green infrastructure pilots. The 2024 UDO update requires low-impact development practices for new projects. A dedicated stormwater enterprise fund, supported by impervious surface fees, finances ongoing maintenance and capital improvements.
