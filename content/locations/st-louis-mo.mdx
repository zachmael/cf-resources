## Climate Snapshot

St. Louis, Missouri sits at the confluence of the Mississippi and Missouri Rivers, with a city population of approximately 293,000 and a metro area of 2.8 million. The city's river-bottom geography, combined with its position at the boundary of humid subtropical and humid continental climate zones, exposes it to virtually every category of climate hazard—flooding, extreme heat, severe storms, and ice events. St. Louis experiences some of the most dramatic temperature swings of any major U.S. city, with summer highs regularly exceeding 100°F and winter lows dropping below 0°F.

The July 2022 flash flood event was historic. Over 9 inches of rain fell on the St. Louis metro in under 12 hours, making it the wettest day ever recorded in the city. The event killed 2 people, flooded 6,000 homes, and caused an estimated $250 million in damages. I-70, I-64, and I-44 were all impassable simultaneously. The event demonstrated that St. Louis's flood risk extends far beyond the Mississippi River floodplain—urban creeks, tributaries, and overwhelmed storm sewers create distributed flood risk across the entire metro.

St. Louis recorded its hottest summer on record in 2023, with 62 days above 90°F and 18 days above 100°F. The city's heat island is intense—a 2022 Washington University study documented temperature differentials of up to 16°F between north St. Louis neighborhoods and suburban areas with mature tree canopy. North St. Louis, the city's poorest and most predominantly Black area, consistently records the highest temperatures.

## Top Climate Risks

### Extreme Heat
St. Louis is one of the hottest major cities in the Midwest, and heat is its deadliest climate risk. The July 1995 heat wave killed 476 people in the metro area—a death toll rivaling Hurricane Katrina. St. Louis recorded 18 days above 100°F in 2023, and wet-bulb temperatures exceeded dangerous thresholds on 15 days. North St. Louis neighborhoods experience extreme heat exposure compounded by poverty, vacancy (30% of parcels are vacant), and the lowest tree canopy in the metro at 12%. Heat-related hospitalizations in the city increased 75% between 2015 and 2023.

### Flash Flooding
The July 2022 event highlighted St. Louis's vulnerability to flash flooding beyond its major rivers. The city's topography—hills funneling into narrow creek valleys—concentrates runoff rapidly. The River Des Peres, Deer Creek, and Maline Creek flood repeatedly during heavy rain. The Metropolitan St. Louis Sewer District (MSD) estimates 15,000 structures in the metro area face repetitive flood risk. MSD's Project Clear, the city's EPA consent decree compliance program, requires $4.7 billion in sewer infrastructure improvements through 2039.

### Severe Storms and Tornadoes
St. Louis sits at the intersection of warm Gulf air and cold northern systems, creating prolific severe weather. The May 2011 EF-4 Joplin tornado—160 miles away—drew attention to the region's tornado risk, and St. Louis itself was struck by an EF-2 tornado in April 2011 that damaged Lambert International Airport. The December 2021 tornado outbreak tracked an EF-3 tornado through the Defiance-Edwardsville corridor in the metro's Illinois suburbs, killing 6 people. Derecho and severe thunderstorm frequency has increased 20% in the 2014-2024 decade.

## Local Climate Action

The City of St. Louis adopted its Climate Action & Adaptation Plan in 2017, updated in 2023, targeting a 50% reduction in community emissions by 2035 and carbon neutrality by 2050 from a 2005 baseline. The plan was developed through the St. Louis Climate Equity Initiative, which centered environmental justice in planning.

MSD's Project Clear is the dominant infrastructure program, investing $4.7 billion over 25 years to address combined sewer overflows and reduce flood risk. The program includes $500 million in green infrastructure commitments. MSD's Rainscaping Program provides incentives for residential rain gardens ($1,500 grants) and rain barrel installations.

St. Louis's Building Energy Improvement Board (BEIB), established in 2020, administers the city's commercial building benchmarking ordinance requiring energy disclosure for buildings over 50,000 square feet. The city achieved 100% renewable electricity for municipal operations in 2022 through an Ameren Missouri green tariff. Sustainability efforts are coordinated through the city's Office of Sustainability, which manages the $2 million annual Equitable Climate Fund directing resources to frontline communities.

## Regulations & Incentives

Missouri has no statewide climate plan or clean energy standard, placing the burden on local governments. However, Ameren Missouri's Integrated Resource Plan (2023) calls for retiring all coal plants by 2035 and deploying 5,400 MW of renewables. Ameren offers net metering, a community solar program, and rebates for insulation, HVAC, and smart thermostats through its Pure Power program.

MSD's impervious surface fee credit provides up to 50% reduction for green infrastructure installations. St. Louis's PACE program enables commercial property owners to finance clean energy improvements through property assessments. The St. Louis Development Corporation provides tax increment financing (TIF) support for projects incorporating significant sustainability features.

Missouri's Property Tax Exemption for Solar and Wind Energy Systems exempts 100% of the added assessed value from property taxes for 25 years. The state's low-income weatherization program serves approximately 4,000 households annually.

## Federal Funding Opportunities

Missouri's IRA Home Energy Rebate allocation totals $127 million. St. Louis residents can access up to $8,000 for heat pumps and $14,000 for income-qualified households. Federal 30% tax credits for solar, batteries, and efficiency improvements run through 2032.

FEMA BRIC awarded $18 million to the St. Louis metro in 2023 for flood mitigation, including $12 million specifically for River Des Peres corridor improvements. FEMA's Flood Mitigation Assistance program has funded $25 million in repetitive-loss property buyouts in the metro since 2020.

The EPA's consent decree with MSD leverages federal water infrastructure funding, including the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law's $55 billion allocation. Missouri has received $800 million in State Revolving Fund allocations since 2022. DOE Weatherization allocated $22 million to Missouri in 2023. HUD's CDBG program provides the City of St. Louis approximately $12 million annually, supporting flood recovery and resilient housing.
