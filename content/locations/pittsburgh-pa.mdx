## Climate Snapshot

Pittsburgh sits at the confluence of the Allegheny, Monongahela, and Ohio Rivers, a geography that defines both its identity and its vulnerability. The city's population of approximately 303,000 (metro area 2.4 million) occupies a terrain of steep hillsides, narrow valleys, and river bottoms that concentrate flood risk and complicate stormwater management. Pittsburgh's 712 sets of public steps—more than any U.S. city—hint at the topographic extremes that make the city simultaneously flood-prone in valleys and landslide-prone on hillsides.

In September 2024, a slow-moving storm system dropped 4.5 inches of rain in 6 hours across Allegheny County, triggering flash floods in dozens of creek valleys and causing over $60 million in damages. The city's aging combined sewer system overflowed at 200+ points, sending untreated sewage into the three rivers. This was the latest in a pattern: in June 2018, a similar event caused $40 million in damages and prompted a federal disaster declaration. The August 2011 flash floods killed 4 people in the region.

Pittsburgh's air quality legacy from its steel-producing past has improved dramatically, but the city still ranks in the top 25 nationally for particulate pollution, according to the American Lung Association's 2024 State of the Air report. Increasing heat—Pittsburgh recorded 28 days above 90°F in 2023, up from a historical average of 12—worsens ground-level ozone and threatens a population with above-average rates of asthma and respiratory disease.

## Top Climate Risks

### Flooding and Stormwater Overflow
Pittsburgh's three-river geography and combined sewer system create a flooding challenge unlike almost any other American city. The Allegheny County Sanitary Authority (ALCOSAN) system experiences over 9 billion gallons of combined sewer overflows annually, making it one of the largest CSO problems in the nation. ALCOSAN's EPA consent decree requires $2 billion in infrastructure improvements by 2036. Flash flooding in the city's 60+ named creek valleys affects thousands of properties; the Pittsburgh Water and Sewer Authority (PWSA) estimates 3,500 structures face repetitive flood risk. Climate projections show a 20% increase in intense rainfall events by 2050.

### Landslides
Pittsburgh experiences more landslides than almost any U.S. city outside the Pacific Northwest. The city's steep slopes, clay-rich soils, and aging retaining infrastructure create conditions where heavy rain triggers destructive slides. PennDOT has documented over 3,000 active landslide sites in Allegheny County. A November 2018 landslide destroyed a section of Route 30 in East Pittsburgh, and a January 2020 slide sent three houses into a ravine in the city's Greenfield neighborhood. Climate-driven increases in winter rainfall and freeze-thaw cycles are projected to accelerate landslide frequency.

### Extreme Heat and Air Quality
Pittsburgh's transition from a cool-climate city to one experiencing regular heat events strains infrastructure and public health systems not designed for prolonged heat. The city's 28 days above 90°F in 2023 doubled the 1980-2000 average. Pittsburgh's industrial legacy means air quality degrades quickly during heat waves—ozone exceedance days have increased 40% since 2010. Neighborhoods in the Mon Valley and near industrial sites experience compounded exposure to heat and pollution.

## Local Climate Action

Pittsburgh's Climate Action Plan 3.0, adopted in 2023, commits to an 80% reduction in greenhouse gas emissions by 2030 and carbon neutrality by 2050. The city was the first in the U.S. to align its climate targets with the Paris Agreement through the 2017 Pittsburgh Climate Pledge following the federal withdrawal.

The city's building energy benchmarking and performance ordinance, enacted in 2021, requires all commercial buildings over 50,000 square feet to report energy use and meet escalating performance targets. Pittsburgh's municipal operations achieved 100% renewable electricity in 2023 through a power purchase agreement for wind energy.

The city's green infrastructure program, integrated into ALCOSAN's wet weather plan, has installed over 200 green infrastructure projects since 2016, including bioswales, rain gardens, and porous pavement. Pittsburgh's urban tree canopy target is 60% by 2030 (from approximately 42% in 2023), supported by the TreeVitalize Pittsburgh partnership with the Western Pennsylvania Conservancy.

## Regulations & Incentives

Pennsylvania's Climate Action Plan (2021) sets a goal of 80% greenhouse gas reduction by 2050 from 2005 levels. The state joined the Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative (RGGI) through executive order in 2019, though legal challenges have delayed full implementation. Pennsylvania's Alternative Energy Portfolio Standard requires 18% of electricity from alternative sources by 2021, including 0.5% solar.

Pittsburgh offers property-assessed clean energy (PACE) financing for commercial energy efficiency and renewable energy projects. The city's stormwater fee credit program provides reductions of up to 50% for green infrastructure. Pennsylvania's Solar Energy Program provides rebates through the Sunshine Program for low-income residential solar installations.

Allegheny County's Building Electrification Incentive, launched in 2024, provides up to $5,000 for commercial heat pump installations, supplementing federal IRA credits. The Pittsburgh Land Bank makes tax-delinquent properties available for green infrastructure projects at reduced cost.

## Federal Funding Opportunities

Pennsylvania's IRA Home Energy Rebate allocation totals $394 million—among the largest in the nation. Pittsburgh residents can access up to $8,000 for heat pump installations and $14,000 for low-income households through HEEHR. Federal 30% tax credits for solar, battery storage, and efficiency improvements remain available through 2032.

FEMA BRIC funding has supported Pittsburgh's flood mitigation efforts, with $8.5 million awarded to Allegheny County in 2023 for green infrastructure and property acquisitions. The EPA's consent decree with ALCOSAN unlocks federal financing mechanisms, and the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law's $55 billion for water infrastructure provides additional pathways for CSO remediation.

The EPA's Climate Pollution Reduction Grants provided southwestern Pennsylvania with $3 million in planning funds. The Appalachian Regional Commission (ARC) provides grants for economic transition and infrastructure in the broader Pittsburgh region. DOE's Weatherization Assistance Program allocated $60 million to Pennsylvania in 2023, the largest state allocation, supporting Pittsburgh's low-income energy efficiency goals.
