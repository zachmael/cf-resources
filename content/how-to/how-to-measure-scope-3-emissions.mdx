## Why Scope 3 Matters

For most organizations, Scope 3 emissions represent 70-90% of total greenhouse gas output. These are the indirect emissions embedded in your value chain — from purchased goods and raw materials to product end-of-life treatment. Ignoring Scope 3 means ignoring the bulk of your climate impact.

Regulatory pressure is accelerating. California's SB 253 (Climate Corporate Data Accountability Act) requires Scope 3 reporting for large companies doing business in the state. The CSRD's European Sustainability Reporting Standards mandate value chain emissions disclosure. The Science Based Targets initiative (SBTi) requires Scope 3 target-setting when these emissions exceed 40% of the total.

## Step 1: Understand the 15 Scope 3 Categories

The GHG Protocol Corporate Value Chain (Scope 3) Standard defines 15 categories:

**Upstream:**
1. Purchased goods and services
2. Capital goods
3. Fuel- and energy-related activities (not in Scope 1 or 2)
4. Upstream transportation and distribution
5. Waste generated in operations
6. Business travel
7. Employee commuting
8. Upstream leased assets

**Downstream:**
9. Downstream transportation and distribution
10. Processing of sold products
11. Use of sold products
12. End-of-life treatment of sold products
13. Downstream leased assets
14. Franchises
15. Investments

Not all categories apply to every organization. A software company won't have Category 10 (processing of sold products). A retailer's Category 11 (use of sold products) will look very different from a car manufacturer's.

## Step 2: Screen for Relevance

Conduct a screening exercise to identify which categories are relevant and material:

- **Relevance test:** Does the category apply to your business model? If you have no franchises, Category 14 is irrelevant.
- **Materiality threshold:** Estimate the magnitude of emissions in each relevant category. Focus detailed measurement on categories likely to exceed 5% of total Scope 3 emissions.
- **Data availability:** Assess whether you can reasonably obtain data for each category. Some categories (like Category 15 — Investments) require specialized approaches.

Document your screening rationale. Auditors and assurance providers will ask why you excluded specific categories.

## Step 3: Select Calculation Methods

The GHG Protocol provides four calculation approaches, ranked from most to least accurate:

1. **Supplier-specific method:** Use actual emissions data from your suppliers (product-level carbon footprints, supplier GHG inventories). Highest accuracy but hardest to obtain.
2. **Hybrid method:** Combine supplier-specific data with secondary data where gaps exist.
3. **Average-data method:** Multiply activity data (e.g., tonnes of material purchased) by industry-average emission factors.
4. **Spend-based method:** Multiply procurement spend by spend-based emission factors (e.g., kg CO₂e per dollar spent). Lowest accuracy but easiest starting point.

Most organizations begin with spend-based calculations and progressively shift toward supplier-specific data for their highest-emitting categories. This is a multi-year journey — don't try to achieve perfect data in year one.

## Step 4: Collect Activity Data

For each category, gather the underlying activity data:

- **Category 1 (Purchased goods/services):** Procurement spend by category, or physical quantities (tonnes of steel, kWh of cloud computing, etc.)
- **Category 4 (Upstream transport):** Tonne-kilometres by transport mode, or logistics spend
- **Category 6 (Business travel):** Distance by travel mode (air, rail, road), or travel spend
- **Category 7 (Employee commuting):** Employee survey data on commute distance and mode, or use regional averages
- **Category 11 (Use of sold products):** Product energy consumption during use phase, estimated lifetime

Work with procurement, logistics, HR, and product teams to source this data. Build collection templates that can be reused annually.

## Step 5: Apply Emission Factors

Match your activity data with appropriate emission factors:

- **Spend-based factors:** US EPA's Supply Chain GHG Emission Factors (USEEIO), Exiobase, or DEFRA spend-based factors
- **Activity-based factors:** DEFRA/BEIS conversion factors, EPA emission factors, IEA electricity factors, ecoinvent LCA database
- **Supplier-specific factors:** Request Product Carbon Footprints (PCFs) from key suppliers, or use CDP Supply Chain data

Always document which emission factor database and version you used. Emission factors change annually.

## Step 6: Calculate and Aggregate

For each category:

`Emissions (tCO₂e) = Activity Data × Emission Factor`

Aggregate across all relevant categories to get your total Scope 3 footprint. Break results out by category — the category-level detail is what drives reduction strategies.

Quality-check your results:

- Do the category proportions make sense for your industry? (Manufacturing companies typically see Category 1 dominate; financial institutions see Category 15 dominate.)
- Are year-over-year changes explainable by business changes, or do they suggest data errors?
- How do your results compare to industry benchmarks?

## Step 7: Identify Hotspots and Set Priorities

Your Scope 3 inventory reveals where to focus reduction efforts:

- Rank categories by absolute emissions
- Identify the top 5-10 suppliers or product categories driving emissions in your largest categories
- Assess which hotspots are addressable (supplier engagement, product redesign, logistics optimization)

This analysis directly feeds your target-setting under SBTi and your climate transition plan.

## Step 8: Improve Data Quality Over Time

Build a multi-year data quality improvement roadmap:

- **Year 1:** Spend-based screening across all categories; activity-based calculations for top 3 categories
- **Year 2:** Supplier engagement program for top 20 suppliers; shift remaining categories to activity-based methods
- **Year 3:** Collect supplier-specific PCFs for top 50 suppliers; refine estimates with primary data

Track data quality scores using the GHG Protocol's data quality indicators (representativeness, completeness, reliability, temporal correlation, geographical correlation).

## Step 9: Report and Disclose

Report your Scope 3 results with:

- Emissions by category (tCO₂e)
- Calculation methodology per category
- Emission factor sources and versions
- Categories excluded and rationale
- Data quality assessment
- Base year and recalculation policy

Align your disclosure with GHG Protocol, GRI 305, ISSB IFRS S2, or ESRS E1 requirements depending on your reporting obligations.

## Frequently Asked Questions

### Which Scope 3 categories should we measure first?
Start with Category 1 (purchased goods and services), Category 6 (business travel), and Category 7 (employee commuting). Category 1 is almost always the largest, and Categories 6-7 have relatively straightforward data collection. Then expand to transport (Category 4) and use of sold products (Category 11) based on your business model.

### How accurate is spend-based data?
Spend-based methods have uncertainty ranges of ±50% or more. They're useful for screening and identifying hotspots but insufficient for tracking year-over-year reductions. Economic fluctuations (inflation, currency changes) can shift results without any real emissions change. Transition to activity-based and supplier-specific methods as quickly as feasible.

### Do we need to measure all 15 categories?
No. You only need to measure categories that are relevant to your business and material in size. However, you must document why you excluded any category. The GHG Protocol requires companies to account for all relevant Scope 3 categories. SBTi requires that your Scope 3 inventory covers at least 67% of total Scope 3 emissions.

### How do we get Scope 3 data from suppliers?
Start by joining or leveraging existing platforms: CDP Supply Chain program, Manufacture 2030, or industry-specific initiatives. Send standardized data request forms to your top suppliers by spend or estimated emissions. Many large suppliers already disclose through CDP. For smaller suppliers, provide guidance on basic emissions calculation and offer support.

### What tools can help with Scope 3 measurement?
Software platforms like Watershed, Persefoni, Sphera, and Plan A automate much of the calculation process. For spend-based analysis, the EPA's USEEIO model is free. For LCA-based product footprinting, tools like SimaPro, GaBi, and openLCA are standard. Choose based on your organization's size, complexity, and budget.
