  - question: "What's the difference between Scope 1, 2, and 3?"
    answer: "Scope 1 covers direct emissions from sources you own or control (boilers, vehicles, process emissions). Scope 2 covers indirect emissions from purchased electricity, heat, and steam. Scope 3 covers all other indirect emissions across your value chain — purchased goods, business travel, employee commuting, product use, and more. Together they represent your full carbon footprint."
  - question: "What emission factors should I use?"
    answer: "Use the most specific factors available. For electricity, use grid-specific factors from IEA or national sources. For fuels, DEFRA (UK) or EPA (US) factors are standard. For Scope 3 categories, ecoinvent provides lifecycle data, while USEEIO or Exiobase offer spend-based factors. Always document which factors you use and their source year."
  - question: "How often should I calculate my carbon footprint?"
    answer: "Annually at minimum, aligned with your fiscal year. Companies with SBTi targets or regulatory reporting obligations need annual inventories. Leading companies calculate quarterly or monthly for operational management. The base year inventory should be recalculated when structural changes exceed 5% of total emissions."

## Why Calculate Your Carbon Footprint

Your carbon footprint is the foundation for all climate action. Without accurate measurement, you cannot set meaningful targets, track progress, identify reduction opportunities, or report to stakeholders. It's the climate equivalent of financial accounting — you need the numbers to manage the business.

Calculating your carbon footprint is required under multiple frameworks: GHG Protocol (the global standard), CSRD/ESRS E1, ISSB IFRS S2, SEC climate rule, California SB 253, CDP, and SBTi. Even where not yet mandatory, investors, customers, and employees increasingly expect it.

## Step 1: Set Organizational and Operational Boundaries

**Organizational boundary**: Choose one of three approaches per the GHG Protocol:
- **Operational control** (most common): Report emissions from operations you control, regardless of ownership percentage
- **Financial control**: Report emissions from operations where you direct financial and operating policies
- **Equity share**: Report your ownership percentage of emissions from each operation

**Operational boundary**: Decide which emission sources to include within your chosen organizational boundary — at minimum all Scope 1, Scope 2, and material Scope 3 categories.

Document your boundary decisions. Consistency across years is critical for meaningful trend analysis.

## Step 2: Identify Emission Sources

Map all sources within your boundary:

**Scope 1 — Direct emissions:**
- Stationary combustion: boilers, furnaces, heaters (natural gas, oil, propane)
- Mobile combustion: company vehicles, forklifts, equipment (gasoline, diesel)
- Process emissions: chemical reactions in manufacturing
- Fugitive emissions: refrigerant leaks, methane from landfills, SF6 from electrical equipment

**Scope 2 — Energy indirect:**
- Purchased electricity (by facility)
- Purchased heating and cooling (district systems)
- Purchased steam

**Scope 3 — Value chain:**
- Screen all 15 categories for relevance
- Quantify material categories (typically those representing >5% of Scope 3 total)
- See our detailed [Scope 3 measurement guide](/how-to/how-to-measure-scope-3-emissions)

## Step 3: Collect Activity Data

For each source, collect the physical activity data needed for calculation:

- **Fuel consumption**: Liters, gallons, cubic meters, or therms by fuel type. Source: utility bills, fuel purchase records, meter readings.
- **Electricity consumption**: kWh by facility. Source: utility bills, sub-meters, building management systems.
- **Refrigerant use**: Kg recharged by refrigerant type. Source: HVAC service records, equipment logs.
- **Vehicle data**: Km/miles driven by vehicle type, or fuel consumed. Source: fleet management systems, fuel cards.
- **Process data**: Production volumes, chemical inputs. Source: production records, ERP systems.

Data quality tips:
- Collect monthly data where possible (reveals seasonal patterns, catches anomalies)
- Cross-check energy consumption against utility costs
- Use metered data over estimated data wherever available
- Document all assumptions and estimation methods

## Step 4: Apply Emission Factors

Convert activity data to CO2e using emission factors:

**Emissions (tCO2e) = Activity Data × Emission Factor**

Key emission factor sources:
- **Fuels**: DEFRA Conversion Factors (updated annually), EPA Emission Factors Hub
- **Electricity (location-based)**: IEA emission factors by country, EPA eGRID for US regions
- **Electricity (market-based)**: Supplier-specific factors from contractual instruments (RECs, GOs, PPAs), residual mix factors
- **Refrigerants**: IPCC AR5 or AR6 GWP values
- **Scope 3**: DEFRA for transport/materials, ecoinvent for lifecycle data, USEEIO for spend-based

Include all six Kyoto gases (CO2, CH4, N2O, HFCs, PFCs, SF6, NF3) where relevant. Convert to CO2 equivalents using 100-year Global Warming Potential values.

## Step 5: Calculate Scope 2 Both Ways

The GHG Protocol Scope 2 Guidance requires dual reporting:

- **Location-based**: Uses average grid emission factors for your location. Reflects the actual emissions from the grid you draw from.
- **Market-based**: Uses emission factors from contractual instruments (supplier-specific factors, RECs, GOs, PPAs). Reflects your purchasing decisions.

The difference matters: if you purchase 100% renewable electricity via RECs, your market-based Scope 2 could be zero while your location-based Scope 2 reflects the grid average. Report both.

## Step 6: Quality Assurance and Verification

Before finalizing your inventory:

- **Internal review**: Have someone other than the compiler review data inputs, calculations, and emission factors
- **Variance analysis**: Compare year-over-year changes. Flag and explain any changes >10%
- **Benchmark**: Compare your emissions intensity (per revenue, per employee, per unit of production) against industry averages
- **Documentation**: Maintain a complete audit trail — data sources, calculation methodologies, assumptions, emission factors with source and version
- **External verification**: Consider third-party assurance (limited or reasonable) for credibility. Required under CSRD.

## Step 7: Report and Use the Results

Your carbon footprint should inform action, not just fill a report:

- **Identify hotspots**: Which sources, facilities, or Scope 3 categories drive the most emissions?
- **Set reduction targets**: Use your baseline to set science-based targets (see our [SBTi guide](/how-to/how-to-set-science-based-targets))
- **Track progress**: Annual recalculation shows whether you're on track
- **Report**: Disclose through sustainability reports, CDP, regulatory filings
- **Communicate**: Share results with employees, investors, and customers

Establish a base year that will serve as your reference point for measuring reduction progress. If significant structural changes occur (mergers, divestitures), recalculate the base year to maintain comparability.
