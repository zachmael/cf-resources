## What a Climate Risk Assessment Covers

A climate risk assessment identifies, evaluates, and prioritizes the physical and transition risks that climate change poses to your organization. It's a core requirement under TCFD, ISSB (IFRS S2), CSRD (ESRS E1), and increasingly under SEC and state-level regulations.

Physical risks arise from the changing climate itself — extreme weather events, rising temperatures, water stress. Transition risks arise from the shift to a low-carbon economy — policy changes, technology disruption, market shifts, reputational pressures. A credible assessment covers both.

## Step 1: Define Scope and Objectives

Clarify the assessment's parameters:

- **Organizational scope:** Which entities, facilities, and operations are included? Include material supply chain nodes if feasible.
- **Geographic scope:** Identify all physical locations — offices, factories, warehouses, data centers, key supplier sites.
- **Value chain scope:** Assess risks to upstream suppliers and downstream customers where you have significant dependencies.
- **Time horizons:** Short-term (1-3 years), medium-term (3-10 years), long-term (10-30+ years). TCFD and ISSB expect all three.
- **Audience:** Who will use the results? Board, investors, risk management, operations?

## Step 2: Catalog Physical Risk Exposures

For each location, identify relevant physical climate hazards:

### Acute Risks (event-driven)
- Tropical cyclones / hurricanes
- Riverine and coastal flooding
- Wildfire
- Extreme heat events
- Severe storms (hail, tornadoes, ice storms)
- Drought

### Chronic Risks (long-term shifts)
- Sea level rise
- Mean temperature increase
- Shifting precipitation patterns
- Water stress and scarcity
- Permafrost thaw
- Ocean acidification (for marine-dependent operations)

**Data sources for hazard identification:**
- NOAA Climate Explorer and National Climate Assessment
- World Bank Climate Change Knowledge Portal
- IPCC Interactive Atlas
- Swiss Re CatNet
- Munich Re NatCatSERVICE
- First Street Foundation (US flood, fire, heat risk)
- WRI Aqueduct (water stress)

Map each facility against these hazards using geographic coordinates. Commercial climate analytics platforms (Moody's, MSCI Climate Lab, S&P Climanomics, Jupiter Intelligence) can automate this step.

## Step 3: Catalog Transition Risk Exposures

Identify how the shift to a low-carbon economy affects your business:

### Policy and Legal
- Carbon pricing (existing and projected emissions trading schemes, carbon taxes)
- Sector-specific regulations (efficiency standards, methane rules, phase-outs)
- Disclosure mandates (CSRD, SEC, California SB 253)
- Litigation risk (climate liability lawsuits, shareholder claims)

### Technology
- Cost declines in renewables, batteries, and EVs threatening incumbent technologies
- Emerging requirements (green hydrogen, CCUS) affecting industrial processes
- Digital infrastructure vulnerabilities to climate extremes

### Market
- Shifting customer preferences toward low-carbon products and services
- Commodity price volatility driven by climate policy (fossil fuel prices, carbon credits)
- Supply chain disruptions from suppliers facing their own climate risks

### Reputation
- Greenwashing allegations and activist campaigns
- ESG rating downgrades
- Employee recruitment challenges if perceived as climate laggard

## Step 4: Select Climate Scenarios

Scenario analysis is central to TCFD, ISSB, and CSRD requirements. Use at least two scenarios:

- **Orderly transition (1.5°C or well-below 2°C):** Aggressive policy action, rapid decarbonization. High transition risk, lower long-term physical risk. Reference: IEA Net Zero Emissions (NZE), NGFS Net Zero 2050.
- **Disorderly transition (delayed action):** Late, sudden policy shifts. High transition and physical risk during the adjustment period. Reference: NGFS Delayed Transition.
- **Hot house world (3°C+):** Limited policy action, severe physical impacts. Low transition risk, very high physical risk. Reference: NGFS Current Policies, SSP5-8.5.

For physical risk projections, use IPCC Shared Socioeconomic Pathways (SSPs) — SSP1-2.6 for low warming, SSP2-4.5 for medium, SSP5-8.5 for high. For transition risk, use the Network for Greening the Financial System (NGFS) scenarios or IEA World Energy Outlook scenarios.

## Step 5: Assess Risk Severity and Likelihood

For each identified risk, evaluate:

- **Likelihood:** How probable is this risk materializing under each scenario? (Use a 5-point scale or probability ranges)
- **Financial impact:** What's the potential financial consequence? Categories: revenue loss, increased costs, asset impairment, capital expenditure, insurance costs, litigation liability
- **Time horizon:** When could this risk materialize?
- **Velocity:** How quickly would the impact unfold? (Sudden vs. gradual)
- **Adaptive capacity:** What's your current ability to respond?

Quantify where possible. For physical risks, estimate potential damage costs (property damage, business interruption, supply chain disruption). For transition risks, model the impact of different carbon price scenarios on operating costs.

## Step 6: Assess Climate-Related Opportunities

TCFD and ISSB explicitly ask about opportunities alongside risks:

- **Resource efficiency:** Energy cost savings from efficiency improvements
- **New products/services:** Low-carbon products, climate advisory services, green building
- **New markets:** Access to climate-conscious customers, green procurement programs
- **Resilience:** Competitive advantage from early adaptation investments
- **Capital access:** Favorable financing terms for companies with strong climate strategies

Quantify opportunity value where feasible (e.g., market size for low-carbon product lines, cost savings from fleet electrification).

## Step 7: Prioritize and Create a Risk Register

Build a climate risk register that includes:

| Risk | Type | Scenario | Likelihood | Impact | Time Horizon | Priority |
|------|------|----------|-----------|--------|-------------|----------|
| Coastal flooding at [facility] | Physical - Acute | SSP5-8.5 | High | $X M asset damage | Medium-term | Critical |
| Carbon pricing impact on Scope 1 | Transition - Policy | NZE | Very High | $X M annual cost | Short-term | Critical |

Prioritize risks using a heat map (likelihood × impact). Present the top 10-15 risks to leadership for strategic response planning.

## Step 8: Develop Response Strategies

For each high-priority risk, define a response:

- **Avoid:** Exit high-risk markets or locations
- **Reduce:** Invest in resilience measures (flood protection, supply chain diversification, emissions reduction)
- **Transfer:** Purchase insurance, hedge commodity exposures
- **Accept:** Monitor and plan contingency responses

Link response strategies to capital allocation. Climate risk responses should be reflected in capex budgets, insurance programs, and business continuity plans.

## Step 9: Integrate into Enterprise Risk Management

Climate risk should not sit in a separate silo:

- Add climate risks to your corporate risk register
- Include climate scenarios in financial planning and stress testing
- Brief the board risk committee on climate risk findings
- Update risk appetite statements to reference climate thresholds
- Train risk management staff on climate risk methodology

## Step 10: Disclose Results

Report your climate risk assessment through:

- **TCFD/ISSB disclosures:** Strategy and risk management pillars
- **CSRD/ESRS E1:** Climate-related risks and opportunities, scenario analysis results
- **CDP:** Climate change questionnaire, risk disclosure sections
- **Annual report:** Risk factor discussions, MD&A sections

## Frequently Asked Questions

### Do we need to hire a specialist firm for climate risk assessment?
For a first assessment, external expertise is valuable — especially for physical risk modeling and scenario analysis. Climate analytics firms (Moody's, MSCI, Jupiter Intelligence, S&P) provide location-level physical risk data. Consultants can help with transition risk scenario modeling and financial quantification. After the first cycle, many organizations build internal capability.

### How granular should physical risk analysis be?
Asset-level analysis is the gold standard — assessing each facility against location-specific hazard projections. At minimum, group facilities by geography and assess at the regional level. Avoid national-level averages, which mask significant local variation.

### What time horizons should we use?
TCFD and ISSB expect short (1-3 years), medium (3-10 years), and long-term (10-30+ years) horizons. Physical risks intensify over longer timeframes; transition risks may peak in the medium term under orderly transition scenarios. Define your specific time horizons and use them consistently.

### How do we quantify financial impacts when uncertainty is high?
Use ranges rather than point estimates. Express impacts as scenarios: "Under a $75/tCO₂ carbon price (NGFS Net Zero 2050 scenario), our annual operating costs increase by $2-4M." Sensitivity analysis — showing how results change under different assumptions — is more useful than false precision.
