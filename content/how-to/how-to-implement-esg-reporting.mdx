faqs:
  - question: "What ESG framework should I start with?"
    answer: "For most companies, start with GRI Standards — they're the most widely recognized and provide comprehensive guidance. If you're publicly traded or investor-focused, layer on ISSB (IFRS S1/S2). If you're in CSRD scope, ESRS is mandatory. Many companies report against multiple frameworks using a common data set."
  - question: "How much does ESG reporting cost?"
    answer: "First-year implementation typically costs $100K-$500K for a mid-size company, including consulting, data systems, and staff time. Ongoing annual costs run $50K-$200K. Costs vary significantly based on complexity, framework requirements, and whether you seek external assurance."
  - question: "Can I automate ESG data collection?"
    answer: "Yes, and you should. ESG software platforms like Workiva, Persefoni, Watershed, or Sphera can automate data collection from facilities, HR systems, and supply chains. However, technology alone isn't enough — you need clear data ownership, validation processes, and governance. Start with manual processes to understand the data, then automate."

## Why ESG Reporting Matters

ESG reporting has evolved from a voluntary exercise to a business imperative. Over 90% of S&P 500 companies now publish sustainability reports, and regulatory mandates are making disclosure obligatory for tens of thousands of additional companies worldwide. The CSRD, ISSB standards, SEC climate rule, and California disclosure laws are creating a global reporting ecosystem that most businesses cannot avoid.

Beyond compliance, ESG reporting drives internal value: it identifies operational efficiencies, reveals supply chain risks, strengthens stakeholder relationships, and improves access to capital. Companies with strong ESG disclosure consistently achieve lower cost of capital and higher valuations.

## Step 1: Assess Regulatory Requirements and Stakeholder Expectations

Before selecting frameworks or building systems, understand what you must and should report:

- **Regulatory scan**: Identify mandatory reporting obligations based on your jurisdiction, size, and listing status. Key regulations include CSRD (EU), SEC climate rule (US public companies), ISSB-adopting jurisdictions (UK, Australia, Canada, Japan), California SB 253/261, and national requirements.
- **Investor expectations**: Review ESG questionnaires you receive (CDP, MSCI, Sustainalytics, ISS) and investor engagement feedback. These reveal what your capital providers want to see.
- **Customer requirements**: Many B2B companies face ESG questionnaires from enterprise customers, particularly in regulated industries.
- **Peer benchmarking**: Analyze what industry leaders disclose, which frameworks they use, and their reporting maturity.

Map these requirements into a consolidated framework that identifies common datapoints across multiple stakeholder needs.

## Step 2: Select Your Reporting Frameworks

Choose frameworks based on regulatory obligations and strategic priorities:

- **GRI Standards**: Most comprehensive, stakeholder-oriented. Required by many stock exchanges and widely expected by ESG ratings agencies.
- **ESRS (European Sustainability Reporting Standards)**: Mandatory for CSRD-scope companies. Detailed, prescriptive, and based on double materiality.
- **ISSB (IFRS S1/S2)**: Investor-focused, financially material disclosure. Increasingly adopted as baseline in multiple jurisdictions.
- **SASB Standards**: Industry-specific metrics now part of the ISSB family. Still widely used standalone for sector-specific materiality.
- **TCFD**: Climate-specific disclosure framework. Governance, Strategy, Risk Management, Metrics & Targets.
- **CDP**: Questionnaire-based disclosure for climate, water, and forests. Uses TCFD structure.

Most companies use 2-3 frameworks. Map overlapping requirements to avoid duplicate data collection.

## Step 3: Conduct Materiality Assessment

Materiality determines which topics matter for your report. See our detailed guide on [conducting a materiality assessment](/how-to/how-to-conduct-a-materiality-assessment).

Key outputs: prioritized list of material ESG topics, documentation of the assessment process, and board approval.

## Step 4: Build Data Infrastructure

ESG data is the foundation of credible reporting. Build systems that scale:

**Environmental data:**
- Energy consumption by source and facility (utility bills, meters, BMS systems)
- GHG emissions (calculated from activity data using emission factors)
- Water withdrawal, consumption, and discharge
- Waste generated by type and disposal method
- Renewable energy procurement and certificates

**Social data:**
- Employee headcount, demographics, diversity metrics
- Health and safety incidents (LTIR, TRIR)
- Training hours and programs
- Living wage analysis
- Supply chain labor audits and findings
- Community investment and engagement

**Governance data:**
- Board composition and independence
- ESG oversight structure
- Executive compensation links to ESG
- Ethics and compliance incidents
- Lobbying and political contributions

**Data quality principles:**
- Define clear ownership for every metric
- Establish collection frequency (monthly/quarterly, not annual scrambles)
- Implement validation checks (year-over-year variance, benchmarks)
- Maintain audit trails documenting data sources and calculations
- Conduct internal quality assurance before external reporting

## Step 5: Establish Governance and Accountability

ESG reporting requires organizational commitment:

- **Board oversight**: Assign ESG reporting oversight to a board committee (audit, sustainability, or risk committee)
- **Executive ownership**: Appoint a senior executive (CFO, CSO, or COO) as the ESG reporting sponsor
- **Cross-functional working group**: Include representatives from sustainability, finance, legal, HR, operations, procurement, and IT
- **Policies**: Develop an ESG reporting policy covering scope, frameworks, data management, internal controls, and assurance
- **Internal controls**: Apply the same rigor to ESG data as financial data — segregation of duties, review procedures, documentation requirements

## Step 6: Write and Publish Your Report

Structure your ESG report for both compliance and readability:

1. **Strategy and governance**: How ESG connects to business strategy, board oversight, risk management integration
2. **Material topics**: For each material topic — management approach, policies, actions, performance data, targets
3. **Performance data**: Comprehensive data tables with multi-year trends, methodological notes
4. **Framework indices**: GRI Content Index, SASB disclosure table, TCFD alignment, ESRS datapoint mapping
5. **Assurance statement**: Third-party assurance report (limited or reasonable)

Publish in formats that serve different audiences: PDF for comprehensive stakeholders, web-based for accessibility and SEO, XBRL for regulators, data files for ESG ratings agencies.

## Step 7: Seek External Assurance

Assurance significantly increases report credibility:

- **Limited assurance**: Review-level engagement. The assurer checks processes and samples data. Required under CSRD.
- **Reasonable assurance**: Audit-level engagement with extensive testing. CSRD plans to mandate this by 2028.

Engage your assurer early in the reporting cycle so they can advise on evidence requirements and test controls throughout the year.

## Step 8: Continuous Improvement

Each reporting cycle should be better than the last:

- **Post-mortem**: After each report, document what worked, what didn't, and improvement actions
- **Expand scope**: Progressively add topics, improve Scope 3 coverage, strengthen data quality
- **Technology**: Invest in ESG data management platforms as your reporting matures
- **Integration**: Move toward integrated reporting where ESG and financial data tell one coherent story
- **Stakeholder feedback**: Actively seek and incorporate feedback from investors, ratings agencies, and assurers
