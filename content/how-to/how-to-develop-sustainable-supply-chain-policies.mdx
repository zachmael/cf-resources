title: "How to Develop Sustainable Supply Chain Policies"
description: "A comprehensive guide to building sustainability into procurement and supply chain management, from codes of conduct to monitoring, due diligence, and remediation."
category: "Supply Chain"
lastUpdated: "2026-02-26"
faqs:
  - question: "What regulations require sustainable supply chain management?"
    answer: "Key regulations include: the German Supply Chain Due Diligence Act (LkSG), EU Corporate Sustainability Due Diligence Directive (CSDDD), EU Deforestation Regulation, California Transparency in Supply Chains Act, UK Modern Slavery Act, French Duty of Vigilance Law, and CSRD (which requires value chain disclosures). These create legal obligations for supply chain environmental and human rights due diligence."
  - question: "How do I prioritize which suppliers to engage?"
    answer: "Use a risk-based approach: prioritize based on spend volume, geographic risk (countries with weak governance, high deforestation, poor labor protections), commodity risk (palm oil, cocoa, minerals, garments), and strategic importance. Typically, your top 50-100 suppliers represent 80%+ of spend and risk. Start there and expand."
  - question: "What certifications should I require from suppliers?"
    answer: "Certifications depend on your industry and risk areas. Common ones include: ISO 14001 (environmental management), SA8000 (social accountability), FSC (timber/paper), RSPO (palm oil), Fairtrade, Rainforest Alliance, EcoVadis (cross-cutting sustainability assessment). Don't rely solely on certifications — complement with audits and direct engagement."

## Why Sustainable Supply Chains Matter

For most companies, 50-90% of environmental and social impacts occur in the supply chain. Your Scope 3 emissions, human rights risks, deforestation exposure, and water impacts are predominantly driven by supplier activities. You cannot be a sustainable company with an unsustainable supply chain.

Regulations are making this explicit. The EU CSDDD requires companies to conduct due diligence on human rights and environmental impacts throughout their value chains, with liability for failures. The German LkSG already applies to companies with 1,000+ employees. The EU Deforestation Regulation requires due diligence for forest-risk commodities. CSRD requires value chain disclosures for material topics.

## Step 1: Develop Your Supplier Code of Conduct

Your code of conduct sets expectations for all suppliers. It should cover:

**Environmental requirements:**
- GHG emissions measurement and reduction
- Energy efficiency and renewable energy
- Water management and pollution prevention
- Waste reduction and circular practices
- Biodiversity protection and deforestation-free sourcing
- Chemical management and hazardous substance restrictions

**Social requirements:**
- Prohibition of forced labor, child labor, and human trafficking
- Fair wages and working hours
- Freedom of association and collective bargaining
- Non-discrimination and equal opportunity
- Occupational health and safety
- Community engagement and land rights

**Governance requirements:**
- Anti-corruption and anti-bribery
- Data privacy and security
- Grievance mechanisms for workers
- Subcontractor management
- Transparency and disclosure cooperation

Make the code contractually binding by incorporating it into supplier agreements. Require suppliers to cascade requirements to their own suppliers (tier 2+).

## Step 2: Conduct Supply Chain Risk Assessment

Map and prioritize risks across your supply base:

1. **Supplier mapping**: Build a comprehensive database of suppliers including geography, commodities, spend, and tier level. For critical commodities, map beyond tier 1 to raw material sources.
2. **Risk screening**: Use country-level and sector-level risk indicators to screen for environmental and social risks. Tools include Maplecroft, Verisk Maplecroft, INFORM Risk Index, and industry-specific databases.
3. **Commodity risk assessment**: Identify high-risk commodities in your supply chain — minerals from conflict zones, agricultural commodities linked to deforestation, textiles from regions with labor risks.
4. **Prioritization**: Combine risk scores with spend volume and strategic importance to create a prioritized supplier engagement list.

## Step 3: Implement Due Diligence Processes

Align with the UN Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights and OECD Guidelines for Multinational Enterprises:

1. **Embed responsible business conduct** into policies, management systems, and supplier contracts
2. **Identify and assess** actual and potential adverse impacts through risk assessments, audits, and stakeholder engagement
3. **Cease, prevent, or mitigate** adverse impacts through corrective action plans, supplier development, and process changes
4. **Track** implementation and results through KPIs, audit follow-up, and continuous monitoring
5. **Communicate** how impacts are addressed through public reporting
6. **Provide or cooperate in remediation** when you have caused or contributed to adverse impacts

This six-step framework satisfies the CSDDD, German LkSG, and French Duty of Vigilance requirements.

## Step 4: Assess and Monitor Suppliers

Use multiple mechanisms for ongoing supplier assessment:

- **Self-assessment questionnaires (SAQs)**: Annual questionnaires covering environmental, social, and governance practices. Use standardized platforms (EcoVadis, CDP Supply Chain, SEDEX/Smeta) for efficiency.
- **Third-party audits**: On-site audits for high-risk suppliers. Unannounced audits are more effective for social compliance. Use recognized audit protocols (SA8000, BSCI, ISO standards).
- **Certifications**: Require or incentivize relevant certifications as evidence of management system maturity.
- **Continuous monitoring**: Use news monitoring, satellite imagery (for deforestation), and data analytics to detect emerging risks between audit cycles.
- **Worker voice**: Implement or require worker feedback mechanisms (hotlines, apps) that bypass management to reach workers directly.

## Step 5: Engage and Develop Suppliers

Compliance alone doesn't transform supply chains. Build supplier capability:

- **Training programs**: Provide training on sustainability practices, GHG measurement, energy efficiency, labor rights. Invest especially in SME suppliers who lack internal expertise.
- **Collaborative improvement**: Work with suppliers on joint improvement projects rather than just auditing and penalizing.
- **Incentive mechanisms**: Reward sustainability performance through preferred supplier status, longer contracts, payment term improvements, or co-investment.
- **Industry collaboration**: Join industry sustainability programs (Responsible Business Alliance, Together for Sustainability, Sustainable Apparel Coalition) to align standards and share resources.
- **Capacity building for smaller suppliers**: Recognize that SME suppliers may need support to meet your requirements. Provide toolkits, subsidized training, or access to sustainability consultants.

## Step 6: Establish Remediation Processes

When issues are found, have clear processes for response:

- **Severity classification**: Categorize findings as critical (zero tolerance — forced labor, imminent safety hazard), major (corrective action within 30-90 days), or minor (improvement within 6-12 months)
- **Corrective Action Plans (CAPs)**: Require suppliers to submit root cause analysis and corrective action plans with timelines
- **Follow-up verification**: Verify corrective actions through re-audits or evidence review
- **Remediation for affected people**: Where harm has occurred, provide or cooperate in remediation — compensation, rehabilitation, or access to justice
- **Escalation and exit**: If suppliers refuse to improve after good-faith engagement, responsible exit may be necessary — but only after ensuring workers aren't left worse off

## Step 7: Report and Communicate

Transparent supply chain reporting builds trust:

- **Annual sustainability report**: Disclose supply chain policies, due diligence processes, audit results, and improvement outcomes
- **CSRD/ESRS S2**: Report on workers in the value chain — policies, engagement, due diligence, remediation
- **Modern slavery statements**: UK, Australia, and other jurisdictions require annual disclosure
- **Supplier transparency**: Consider publishing your supplier list (a growing trend led by apparel and electronics companies)
- **Grievance mechanism reporting**: Share data on grievances received, investigated, and resolved
