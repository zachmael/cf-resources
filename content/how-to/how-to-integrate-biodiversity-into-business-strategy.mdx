  - question: "Why should businesses care about biodiversity?"
    answer: "Over half of global GDP ($44 trillion) depends on nature. Biodiversity loss creates direct business risks: supply chain disruption from ecosystem degradation, regulatory risk from new nature-related requirements (CSRD E4, TNFD), reputational risk from habitat destruction, and financial risk from nature-dependent asset impairment. It also creates opportunities in nature-based solutions, sustainable sourcing, and regenerative practices."
  - question: "What frameworks exist for corporate biodiversity?"
    answer: "Key frameworks include: TNFD (Taskforce on Nature-related Financial Disclosures) for risk assessment and disclosure, SBTN (Science Based Targets for Nature) for target-setting, CSRD ESRS E4 for mandatory EU reporting, the Kunming-Montreal Global Biodiversity Framework for national targets, and the Natural Capital Protocol for internal valuation. These are complementary, not competing."
  - question: "Where do I start if my company has never addressed biodiversity?"
    answer: "Start with the TNFD's LEAP approach: Locate your interface with nature (map where your operations and supply chain interact with ecosystems), Evaluate dependencies and impacts, Assess risks and opportunities, and Prepare to respond. A desktop screening using tools like IBAT, ENCORE, and WWF Biodiversity Risk Filter can be completed in weeks and provides a foundation for action."

## Why Biodiversity Matters for Business

The World Economic Forum consistently ranks biodiversity loss among the top five global risks by impact. This is not an abstract environmental concern — it's a direct business issue. Companies depend on ecosystem services (pollination, water purification, soil fertility, flood regulation, climate regulation) throughout their value chains. When ecosystems degrade, supply chains break, costs rise, and regulatory penalties follow.

The regulatory landscape is tightening rapidly. CSRD ESRS E4 requires disclosure on biodiversity impacts, dependencies, risks, and opportunities. The TNFD published its final recommendations in September 2023. The EU Deforestation Regulation prohibits products linked to deforestation. SBTN is developing science-based targets for nature. Companies that ignore biodiversity now will face catch-up costs later.

## Step 1: Understand Your Nature Interface

Use the TNFD LEAP approach to systematically assess your relationship with nature:

**Locate** your interface with nature:
- Map operational sites, supply chain origins, and logistics routes
- Overlay with biodiversity-sensitive areas using IBAT (Integrated Biodiversity Assessment Tool)
- Identify Key Biodiversity Areas (KBAs), protected areas, and high conservation value areas within your footprint
- Use the ENCORE tool to map sector-level dependencies on ecosystem services

**Evaluate** dependencies and impacts:
- Dependencies: Which ecosystem services does your business rely on? (e.g., water provision, pollination, raw materials, climate regulation)
- Impacts: What are your actual and potential impacts on nature? (e.g., habitat conversion, pollution, invasive species introduction, resource extraction)
- Use the Biodiversity Risk Filter (WWF) to screen supply chain commodities and geographies

**Assess** risks and opportunities:
- Physical risks: Supply disruption from ecosystem degradation
- Transition risks: Policy changes, market shifts toward nature-positive products
- Systemic risks: Tipping points in critical ecosystems
- Opportunities: Nature-based solutions, regenerative practices, sustainable sourcing premiums

**Prepare** to respond with governance, strategy, risk management, and metrics & targets.

## Step 2: Apply the Mitigation Hierarchy

The mitigation hierarchy is the foundational principle for managing biodiversity impacts:

1. **Avoid**: Prevent impacts from occurring in the first place. This is the most effective and cost-efficient step. Avoid locating operations in biodiversity-sensitive areas. Avoid sourcing commodities linked to habitat destruction.

2. **Minimize**: Reduce the duration, intensity, and extent of impacts that cannot be fully avoided. Implement pollution controls, seasonal restrictions on construction, sustainable harvesting practices.

3. **Restore**: Rehabilitate degraded ecosystems where impacts have occurred. Restore habitat, replant native vegetation, remediate contamination.

4. **Offset/Compensate**: As a last resort, compensate for residual impacts through biodiversity offsets — conservation actions that achieve equivalent or greater biodiversity gains elsewhere.

Each step is less effective and more expensive than the previous one. Prioritize avoidance and minimization.

## Step 3: Set Science-Based Targets for Nature

The Science Based Targets Network (SBTN) provides a framework for corporate nature targets:

- **Freshwater targets**: Reduce water use in stressed basins, improve water quality
- **Land targets**: Reduce land-use impacts, avoid conversion of natural habitats
- **Biodiversity targets**: No net loss or net positive impact on biodiversity
- **Ocean targets**: Under development

SBTN's approach mirrors SBTi for climate: assess your baseline, set targets aligned with scientific thresholds, and implement actions to achieve them. While still evolving, early adoption signals leadership.

## Step 4: Embed in Procurement and Supply Chain

For most companies, the majority of biodiversity impact occurs in the supply chain:

- **Commodity risk mapping**: Identify high-risk commodities (palm oil, soy, beef, cocoa, timber, coffee, rubber) and their sourcing origins
- **Deforestation-free commitments**: Implement and verify zero-deforestation policies for forest-risk commodities (EU Deforestation Regulation compliance)
- **Sustainable sourcing standards**: Require certifications (FSC, RSPO, Rainforest Alliance) or equivalent verification for high-risk inputs
- **Supplier engagement**: Work with suppliers to understand and improve their biodiversity practices
- **Traceability**: Build supply chain traceability systems to verify claims back to source

## Step 5: Invest in Nature-Based Solutions

Nature-based solutions can address business needs while generating biodiversity benefits:

- **Water management**: Constructed wetlands, riparian restoration, watershed protection (often cheaper than grey infrastructure)
- **Carbon sequestration**: Reforestation, afforestation, soil carbon enhancement (co-benefits with climate strategy)
- **Climate adaptation**: Green infrastructure for flood management, urban cooling, coastal protection
- **Ecosystem restoration**: Habitat restoration on company-owned or -influenced land

Ensure nature-based solutions deliver genuine biodiversity outcomes — monoculture tree plantations don't count.

## Step 6: Report and Disclose

Align your biodiversity disclosure with emerging standards:

- **TNFD**: Recommended disclosures across Governance, Strategy, Risk & Impact Management, and Metrics & Targets
- **CSRD ESRS E4**: Mandatory for EU-reporting companies where biodiversity is material. Covers impacts, dependencies, risks, transition plans, targets, and metrics
- **CDP Forests and Water Security questionnaires**: Investor-focused disclosure on nature-related performance
- **GBF Target 15**: National reporting on business biodiversity disclosure

Metrics to track and report:
- Area of operations in or near biodiversity-sensitive areas
- Hectares of habitat protected, restored, or created
- Deforestation-free compliance rate for high-risk commodities
- Water quality and quantity metrics in stressed basins
- Species monitoring data (where relevant)
